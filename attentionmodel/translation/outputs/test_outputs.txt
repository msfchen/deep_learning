You know what I do is write for kids, and in fact, I'm probably the author for children, more read in the U.S.
And I always tell people that I don't want to seem like a scientist.
I can take it like farmer, or with leather clothes, and you never chose a farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that <unk> is usually something that fell somewhere.
You just have to turn the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complicated circle that I'm going to talk about.
My circle started in the middle of the middle school, <unk> Ohio where I was the rare of the class.
When I took it up to bleed every week in the bathroom, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life for letting me go into the bathroom in the room of the house.
He was doing it in secret.
For three years.
And I had to go from the city.
He had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California, I found a lover -- and in the <unk> years, I felt the need to start working in organizations who were fighting against AIDS.
About three or four years ago, half of the night I got a phone call from that <unk> <unk> lady who said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> that adults never get to know us.
You could take it to Ohio and please bring that man that I know you've found.
And I have to tell you that I have <unk> <unk> and I'd like you to do with this please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
And we went to see, we got <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found it a place, and we found it a place, and it was <unk> and we got rid of her family, because it was necessary, because it was necessary,
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman who wanted to <unk> as an adult arrived at <unk> became a box of ashes and it was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle had closed, it had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I told you about it was done in the way itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I saved the <unk>
And you know that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs true and beauty, and I'm very happy that I talked about this.
It also needs -- needs to be dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our job to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and that everything is interconnected.
I was for the first time to Antarctica about 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can fast, I was <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
I pushed me around the water -- almost 60 feet, and I couldn't even think it was about a <unk> on another <unk> on another <unk> year <unk>
<unk> are born when they fall out of the glaciers or the <unk>
Each iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some of you refuse to refuse and hold it up to the end, while others can't be able to get more and <unk> in a <unk> passion <unk>
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that are isolated <unk> and alone, as much as we see us sometimes as humans.
But the reality is the opposite.
So as a <unk> I am breathing your atmosphere <unk>
As an iceberg melts in the <unk> freshwater in minerals that feeds many forms of life.
I come up to photograph these <unk> as if it was about the portraits of my ancestors -- knowing that in these unique moments exist in that way and won't get to exist in that way again.
It's not the death when it's <unk> it's not an end, but a continuation of their way for the cycle of life.
Part of the ice in the <unk> that I photograph is very <unk> it has a couple of thousands of years.
And another part of the ice is over 100 thousand years.
The last few pictures I'd like to show you are from an iceberg that I photographed in <unk> Greenland.
It's unlikely to actually come to the <unk> <unk>
Here it is.
You can see the left one little boat.
It's about five feet.
And I'd like to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your <unk> line.
You can see here, it starts <unk> the ship has moved to the other side and the man is standing up there.
This is a <unk> iceberg in size.
<unk> of water about 120 feet or 40 meters.
This video is in real time.
And so <unk> the iceberg shows a different side of his personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every single baby, a baby. Okay.
So, two couples every one with a baby.
I don't want you to get too much in the details of conception, because if they stop thinking about conception I don't pay attention to me.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage, I want you to imagine that, in one case, the chromosome and sperm is joined by the X chromosome from the <unk>
And in the other case, the sperm X is joined by the X chromosome from the <unk>
Both <unk> and it starts life.
We'll go back to talk about them later.
In my ground that I will show two roles.
In one of my <unk> I work with the story of anatomy.
I am <unk> by training and what I study in this case is the way that people are doing, the anatomy of human bodies and <unk> how have the body fluids.
The other role that performance in my work is an activist, as a <unk> of patients or, as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical features challenge social norms.
I've been working for example, for example, two twins, two people inside one body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people much more low than the average.
And I've worked with many cases of people with sex sex, individuals whose physics typology doesn't fit in the male male and female <unk>
In the general lines, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> adopt many ways.
I'm going to give you a few examples in ways of having a sex that doesn't get <unk> in the normal or female form.
For example, there's the case of the individual using <unk> <unk> which is the <unk> gene of the chromosome -- and it tells the <unk> that we all have in the life that we all have in the life that we have in <unk> life.
And then, in the life of the testicles produce testosterone.
But because this individual lacks testosterone, the body is not reacting to the same.
It's <unk> syndrome.
So, there are high levels of testosterone but <unk>
As a consequence, the body develops following a course typically <unk>
When he <unk> the baby looks like a child.
It's a girl. It's raised as a little girl.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing and developing hunger, but it doesn't have a period of money, when someone realizes something is going on.
After doing it tests you realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> it actually has testicles and a chromosome.
The important thing to understand is that you can think that it's a man, but it's not really like that.
Women, like men, we have in the body something called <unk> <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the hormone <unk>
Most women like me -- I consider a female woman who doesn't know his <unk> structure, I believe being a typical woman of most women as I are sensitive to the <unk>
We produce <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a consequence, someone like me has the most exposed brain to the <unk> that the woman who was born with testicles who has the <unk> syndrome.
So sex is something complicated. It's not that the <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in some form they can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago, I got a call from a 19 year-old man called and raised as <unk> he had girlfriend, and sexual relationships with her, he was wearing a life as a kid, and I had just figured out he had <unk> and <unk>
He had an extreme way of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
I had the 20th chromosomes in the uterus -- the <unk> glands were so active that in essence, created a male hormone environment.
As a consequence, their genitals were exposed to their brain was exposed to the hormone component typically the male.
He was born with <unk> nobody <unk> nothing.
And it went to the 19, when he started having medical problems caused by the internal <unk> when the doctors discovered that, in fact, was women on it.
Well, another example of a case of <unk>
Some people with the 20th chromosomes develop what is known as <unk> is to say, have tissue <unk> wrapped up in <unk> tissue.
We don't know what that happens.
So, there's many varieties of sex.
The reason that children with this kind of bodies are going to be <unk> twins, or <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> to surgery, is not to be able to have a better physical health better.
In many cases people are perfectly healthy.
The reason that it takes to several surgeries is that they're a threat to our social categories.
The system is based usually in the idea that a particular anatomy brings up a particular identity.
We have the idea that being woman is having a <unk> identity -- it means being black wants to say to have African anatomy in the historical terms.
A terribly simplistic idea.
And when you present a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of the very romantic.
Imagine how amazing it is to have children who are born as two people inside one body.
The most high case is from last year with the <unk> South <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> his sex in the <unk> <unk>
A lot of journalists called them to ask, "What do you test are going to do to determine whether to <unk> <unk> is man or <unk>
And I had to explain to the reporters that there is no such test.
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't plot a <unk> line between men and women or women and <unk> and women and <unk> are us who we draw that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more we are going to science, more we have to admit that these categories -- we thought that we were thinking about these categories that we thought would be made directly with <unk> <unk> <unk> are much more <unk> than they would be.
And not only in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race, something that happens much more complicated than the terminology <unk>
As we see, we get into a <unk> terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What do you mean from the fact that they were in just a few <unk>
And as we go through the science of science, we get more and more in a very awkward zone that we have to recognize that the categories that are likely to recognize are too much <unk>
And we're looking at this in every aspect of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States today, are the struggles in the beginning and in the end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today <unk> not in public, but I know within the <unk> of when someone considered killed.
Our ancestors had never had to get away with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a little bit of him put a pen in front of the nose, and if he moved it still yet.
If I stopped moving through it <unk>
But we can, for example, extract vital organs from a body and put them in another body.
And as a result, we need to deal with a prisoner's dilemma really <unk> and this puts us in a hard situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And you might think that this explosion of categories could be happy to someone like me.
In politics I'm progressive, to people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that he gets nervous.
They would make sure that these categories are much more fragile than we thought I was born.
I think of the concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension -- I have to admit that I am a fervent fan of Parents <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and audacious and so radical in what they did, which I find every so much watching that musical <unk> <unk> and not for the music, which is totally <unk>
That's why he happened in <unk> with the Founding <unk>
The Parents <unk> were to me, the first activists of the anatomy and explain why.
What they <unk> was a <unk> concept, and it was <unk> with another which was radical and beautiful and stayed for 200 years.
And as everybody remembers what our wives did, the <unk> was the idea of the <unk> <unk> was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The monarchs in the old world didn't know about DNA, but they had a clear idea of the right of birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were from the idea that the political power was coming to the political power of the <unk> the father and then the son, etc.
The Founding <unk> rejected that idea and replaced this idea for a new concept, and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They <unk> the game field, and they decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not the <unk> differences that was very radical.
And in part they were doing it because they were part of a <unk> system where they were <unk> two things.
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time <unk> science.
And there's a lot of clear, if you look at the story of the Parents -- I think many were very interested in science and the idea of a world <unk>
They were <unk> from the <unk> explanations and therefore <unk> the concept of being able to be passed on by a <unk> idea of <unk>
They were moving into a <unk> concept.
And if you look at it, for example, the Declaration of Independence and talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And as a result, they were passing the idea of <unk> <unk>
And by doing so, they were <unk> the foundations of the future rights <unk>
They didn't think of that way, but they did it for us and it was great.
And what happened next?
And the women.
Then he came the success of the Civil Rights movement with people from the <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the parts of the Civil Rights movement saying, "I'm a man."
And again, people from color to <unk> <unk> about the difference -- and again, <unk>
We see the same thing with the Indian movement.
The problem is, of course, as we look at the <unk> we have to start asking questions why we have certain <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For example: I don't want to give a fish to a human.
I don't want to say that we should be able to focus on anatomy.
I don't want to say that the five-year-old was supposed to have sexual relationships or married.
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me and I think we should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why do they keep them and make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two things that are going back to the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> both in the same day, exactly the same day.
Imagine that one of them, Mary, was born three months before time: June 1, 1980.
At the contrary, I was born in term: <unk> was born.
For the fact that I was born three months before Mary is attributed to all the rights three months before Henry -- the right to the sex consent, the right to vote, the right to <unk> the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all that not because it has a different biological age, but because it was born afterwards.
We found other <unk> in relation to their rights.
By virtue of being considered a man -- if I haven't told you whether it's <unk> by virtue of being considered to be considered to be a man in the morning of the African <unk> that Mary doesn't have to worry.
Mary, because of your hand, it doesn't have the same rights as a marriage in all states, for example.
Henry can marry all of the states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman only in some states.
So there are still <unk> categories that in various aspects are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is, what do we do now that science goes both in the field of anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy could be <unk>
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like science is <unk>
Where are we going on?
It seems that what happens in our culture is kind of a <unk> attitude attitude and we have to draw the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people are stuck in a strange position.
For example, Texas at a moment has decided that to marry a man you don't have to have chromosome -- and that to marry a woman you have to have the Y.
Now, in practice, they don't do tests for people to help people.
But this is also very strange for the story that I told you at the beginning of the <unk>
If you look at one of the founders of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech "I want to <unk> it offers a solution.
It tells you that we should judge people in the color of their skin, but on the content of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea looks pretty good.
But in practice, how do you do?
How do people judge people based on their <unk>
I want to point out also that I'm not sure we should be able to focus on this for human rights to people, because I admit that I know from some <unk> <unk> who probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that perhaps some of them -- that I know that they can make more intelligent <unk> decisions.
So how do you put the subject of <unk>
It's very difficult.
And a part of me asks what would happen if the character of one person could be measured by an instrument, maybe with an MRI machine.
We want to really get to that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that America will continue to lead this current thinking of thinking about democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like the Iranian person that a man who feels attracted to other men is susceptible to being <unk> unless it's willing to submit to a sex change in which case it is allowed to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like the surgeon that I talked about a couple of years ago that I had done to give birth twins to then pick up and then pick up their fame.
But when the phone asked him, I asked the operation -- he was very <unk> he said that in that other country these children would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
I said, "Well, it's considered political asylum instead of <unk> <unk>
The U.S. offers huge possibilities to people who are without <unk> to change the end of the state.
So I think we need to be on the head.
Well, to finish up I mean I've been talking about the <unk>
And I want to think about what democracy would be, or as it might have been, if we had given more participation to <unk>
And I want to say something a bit radical for a feminist, and it is that I think there may be different ideas coming from different <unk> <unk> in particular if there are people thinking about a group.
Since years ago, since I've been interested in <unk> I've also been interested in looking at the sexual difference.
And one of the things that has been interested in is the differences between men and women in the way to think and operate in the world.
And what we know about <unk> studies is that women, on average, not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and to deal with those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my advisers who knew I was interested in feminism was <unk> I considered a <unk> <unk>
<unk> what about female <unk>
And I thought, "It's the <unk> question I've heard about.
Feminism has to do with unpicking the stereotypes of gender, so there's nothing female in the <unk>
But the more I thought about the question of the question, it's more like there's something women in the <unk>
I mean, there might be something, on average, something different between the female and the male that makes us more <unk> the complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So if they were older, they were very aware to find the way to protect people in the state of the state, it's possible that we have more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with <unk>
And maybe that's what we need to do in the future when we reframe democracy beyond the <unk> thinking less in the individual body, in terms of identity and thinking more about relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect union -- think about what we do for each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where they want to go live and work, have the ability to choose between at least a bunch of different cities that are competing to attract new residents.
Well, at this point, we're far away from that goal.
There are billions of people in developing countries who don't tell a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that they're worth a lot more than their building cost.
So we could easily go to the world -- maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound <unk> if you've never thought about new cities.
But it just led by the buildings of apartments.
Imagine half of those who wanted to live in apartments as they were owners and the other half still will not afford to do it.
You could try to increase the ability making <unk> in all existing buildings.
But you know the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and the areas that surround them have rules to avoid the <unk> and the building distractions in the construction.
So it would be very difficult to do all those <unk>
But you could go to a totally new place, to build a whole new apartment building completely new, always and when the rules of that place will build the construction instead of putting it up.
And so I proposed that governments will bring new reform zones to contain a big big deal of reform and gave them a name, cities under <unk>
Later I learned that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of <unk>
Did you know that every year about 75,000 people would come from their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009 -- <unk> happened for a constitutional constitutional crisis.
In the following election <unk> <unk> <unk> it was <unk> with a platform in which we <unk> reforms and at the same time reconciliation.
He asked <unk> that was his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk in TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a lot of evidence with users, tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to their most essential.
The first point was the importance of rules, like those rules that say that you can't go and pick up all the current residents of apartments.
It takes a lot of attention to new technologies, but you need so much of technologies like rules to <unk> and usually they're the rules that prevent us forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent him to <unk> a link with the <unk>
He showed it to <unk>
They called me up.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami, a conference room in a hotel.
I tried to explain this point about how valuable cities are, much more valuable than their cost <unk>
And I used this image that shows the value of land in a place like New York City <unk> which, in some cases, are worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract argument, and at some point, when there was a pause, he said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
And the talk was described in very simple terms, that a city under <unk> is a place where it starts with <unk> <unk> a <unk> that <unk> the rules that are going to be able to choose and a choice for people to choose if they want to go to live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> was called me and told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the way that our country is going on.
He asked me to be <unk> and I'd talk about the four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, which included in explaining that to make a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
This airport just covers over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a place that is measuring at least 1,000 square miles.
That's more than 100,000 acres.
All the world's <unk>
The face faces were very serious and <unk>
The leader of Congress came up to the platform and said, "Professor <unk> thank you very much for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
I'm here in my <unk>
So I sat down and they showed the <unk>
And this explained that a new city can offer new choices for people.
There would be a choice of a city to which you might go to be in <unk> instead of hundreds of miles away from the North.
And they also took new options for leaders.
Because the leaders of the government would need help from countries -- they would need to benefit from the countries that were going to help them establish and make the norms of the <unk> so that they could all trust the <unk> so that they could actually trust the <unk> actually <unk>
We went and saw a site.
This picture is there.
It could be easily about a thousand square miles.
And shortly afterwards, the 19 of January, they voted in Congress to <unk> their Constitution and add a constitutional available to make these special special regions.
In a country I had just gone through this <unk> crisis, the voting in Congress for this constitutional <unk> was from <unk> to one.
All of the games in society are in society, the <unk>
To <unk> in the constitution, you have to pass twice in Congress.
On February 17th, it passed over again in a voting other voting by <unk> to one.
Immediately after the voting of the voting to 24 of February, a <unk> about 30 <unk> is to the two places in the world that are most interested in participating in cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new city center that is building in Korea, it's bigger than the center of Boston.
All you see there was built in four years, after they spent four years getting the <unk>
The other country is interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've already built two cities in China and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this practical, this is the point where we are.
They have a place, and they're thinking about a site for the second city.
They're preparing a legal system that would allow the <unk> and to the time it would allow the operating to operate under an external legal system.
A country has been committed to allowing her Supreme Court to allow the last state to ultimately for this new <unk> system.
There's urban builders and cities that are very interested in the project.
They can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know that you've solved is that they have a good number of residents.
There are a lot of companies that wanted to go through the <unk> especially in a place with a trade zone -- and there's a lot of people that would like to go to live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to change the other place.
There's a million to the year that comes from Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave back to their family to get a job, sometimes they are mothers who have to earn the money to just eat or buy clothing.
Unfortunately, sometimes there are even children who are trying to meet with their parents who haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what do you think about building a new city in <unk>
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these all over the world?
What does it look like to think about insist so that families can choose between various cities that are competing for attracting new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends, <unk> asked me to say, "Thank TED <unk>
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what there is inside, I'm going to do a public <unk> and it's that I live obsessed with <unk>
I love to find, with, and more recently, photographing and publish on my blog <unk> colorful and different ones for every time.
But I buy nothing new.
All my clothes is a second hand of <unk> markets and <unk> stores.
Oh, thank you.
<unk> stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and my <unk>
I go to meet people who are <unk> my money goes to a good <unk> My aspect is <unk> and buying it into my personal search for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
It's going to be my size?
I would like color <unk>
less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel that I won.
To go back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what I would do?"
I mean, what brings to someone who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I suit.
I've brought up seven pairs of inner clothes, and nothing else.
It's exactly a week at exactly a week that's all I put in my <unk>
I imagined that it would be able to find everything else that I want to use after you get here to Palm <unk>
And because I don't know how the woman walking through TED in inner clothes,  that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets for this week.
It doesn't sound that interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that believe it or not, I have learned in this adventure of not using new clothing.
Let's start with Sunday.
This is called a brilliant tiger.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
Almost you can always see a phenomenal view for less than 50 dollars.
All of the together, including <unk> it took me <unk> and it's the most expensive thing I've used in the week.
<unk> color is energy.
It's almost <unk> impossible to be <unk> when you're wearing a bright red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> The integration is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
I just know yourself.
If you get rid of the right people -- not just <unk> you <unk>
<unk> <unk> of the child that you get in.
Sometimes people tell me that they seem to play the <unk> or I remember their little <unk>
I like to <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> trust is the key.
If you think you see you good with something, it's almost sure you are.
And if you think you don't look good with something, it probably is true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the 30 years that I really understood their meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person inside your inner and it -- there is no look you can't be <unk>
So there's no excuse for anyone in this audience.
We must be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> A universal truth -- six words for you: <unk> <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal style and only is a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I tried it again and again when people came close to me this week simply because what I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home, at Brooklyn, I'm going to give everything.
Because the lesson that I'm trying to learn about this week is that we have to leave certain things.
I don't need emotionally <unk> to these things, because back in the corner, there will always be another <unk> <unk> <unk> and bright <unk> if there's a little love in my heart and I'm after.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can divide into two parts.
The left side, which is the logical part, and the right side, the right side is the intuitive.
So if you take a scale to measure the <unk> of each <unk> we could design a blueprint for our brain.
For example, this would be somebody who is completely logical.
This would be somebody who is totally intuitive.
So where does your brain do?
Some <unk> for one of these ends, but I think that for most of the members of this audience, your brain is something that -- with a great <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not that they're mutually <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, that just like most of the other quantum quantum physicists, we need quite a logic for <unk> these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need quite intuition to make the experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We're going to play with them and then we look at the <unk> and then we develop our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
So you intuition that you can have developed with the step of the years is the one that says that one thing can be just in a place at a time.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember watching a kid playing in a parking bar.
It was a little boy, and he didn't do it very well, always <unk>
But I bet you play with that parking bar with that parking lot, taught a valuable lesson, and it is that big things not allow the <unk> and they stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have in the world, except you're a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with parking bars and play with these strange little particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover that they do all kinds of really weird things -- like they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called it theory of quantum mechanics.
And at that point it was the physics of a few years ago; you had about quantum mechanics to describe those small particles.
But you didn't need to describe the big objects around us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it doesn't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes play with them, but not a lot.
And I've never seen them.
I mean, nobody saw a <unk>
But it didn't fit it well to my logical side.
Because if it's all made of little particles and all the small particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, so I shouldn't follow the principles of quantum mechanics.
I don't find the reason why it shouldn't be.
And therefore I would feel much better if I could ever demonstrate that a common object is also following the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see that it's been on an overlap of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip here.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the little bit of metal that I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And I'm going to zoom in a little bit. It's just right in the center.
And then we do a good approach, the little <unk> of metal.
What we see is a little bit of a little little little bit of a springboard -- a way of springboard -- and that <unk> supported on a platform.
And then I did this almost like the same way that you would do a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a new chip of silicon again, and I put all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this hole in the way of <unk> swimming in the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum <unk> but it needs a bit of help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how awkward it is to be on an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm on an elevator alone, I do all kinds of weird things, but then when other people go up to do those things, because I don't want to get them to you, or actually <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The colleagues of <unk> objects are not just people -- it's also the light that <unk> and the wind that happens to the side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little bit of metal to behave according to quantum mechanics, we'd have to hold all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
<unk> the lights, then <unk> a <unk> and we pulled it all the air down, and then you take it into a temperature of less than a degree above absolute absolute zero.
Now, when being only in the <unk> the little piece of metal is free of acting as he wants.
So we measured their movements.
We discovered it was moving in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, he was vibrating. And the way he <unk> was like a breath of this way -- like a <unk> that expands and <unk>
And by giving it a soft, we were able to make it <unk> and that doesn't happen at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean that one thing <unk> and they didn't want at the same time?
Let's think of atoms.
In one case, all the trillion atoms that make that piece of metal are still still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down to the bottom.
It's just in certain <unk> when those are <unk>
The rest of the time are <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that the whole piece of metal is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Really.
<unk> <unk> in a clean room to do this for all of those years, because, look at this, the difference on scale between one atom and that piece of metal is more or less the same than the difference between that little bit of metal and you.
So if one single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that metal piece can be in two different places, why not you wouldn't too?
I mean, it's my part of the logic that speech.
So imagine if you were in several places at the same time, how would that be that?
How do you act your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it is when we got it, and we turned the lights and we looked inside the box, we saw that the metal was still there in a single piece.
And I was able to get to this new intuition, apparently all of the objects on the elevator are actually all quantum objects that are just <unk> in a little space.
You hear a lot about that quantum mechanics claims that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so true.
It's more than that, it's more profound.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things around you, literally define who you are, and that's the deep strangeness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago, I was doing another job at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my head that's here and it allowed me to do it.
It took me 18 months to me.
A lot of negotiations and stories, they were going to do it with 17 very interesting museums in nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on <unk>
There's a lot of stories of why we did.
I think my own story is just explains just in this slide and this is the access.
I grew up in India.
I had a great education -- I didn't get married, but I didn't have access to many of these museums and artwork.
So when I started traveling and go to museums, I began to learn a lot.
And working on Google, I try to actually make the desire to make it more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started to do it.
Better that shows you the demo to then tell you a couple of interesting things that we've done from their launch.
So, let's <unk> we're going to <unk>
Look around all the museums there.
There's the gallery, <unk> <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
I'm going to go into one of my favorites, in the <unk> the art of New York City.
There are two ways to do it -- very simple.
We click and <unk> we're inside the museum.
No matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that really doesn't matter.
You move over there and you <unk>
They want to navigate the <unk>
We opened up the top, and with one click, we jumped inside.
They're inside, that you want to go to the end of the hall.
Go ahead and go forward.
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't come to the best.
Now I'm in front of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign here.
If the museum shows us the image, we click there.
See, this is one of the images.
Here's all the information from <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click here right now.
And this is one of the images that we've captured in what we call the technology <unk>
So this picture, for example, I think, about 10,000 million pixels.
And there's a lot of people who ask me, "What do you get with 10,000 million <unk>
So I'm going to show you what you really get with 10,000 million pixels.
You can zoom in around a very simple way.
You see fun things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression doesn't have a price.
But if you really want to do it.
So I started to play, and I found myself with something that was happening there.
And I said, "A moment, this seems <unk>
I came up and discovered that kids were actually playing something.
And I talked a little bit, I talked to some people from the <unk> and I actually discovered that this is a game called <unk> which is to hit a <unk> with a stick on the Tuesday <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get into further deep and you'll see that you can actually get to the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to take the image, so you'll see really what there is.
Here's where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is to come, one second.
So now we're quickly going to jump over again at MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorites, "The night <unk>
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how they Van Gogh actually created this <unk>
It goes up and truth that it was <unk>
I'm going to one of my favorite parts on this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk> <unk> I think I'd never seen this before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There's a lot of things over here, but I don't have time to <unk>
This is the really cool thing. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives the same.
You can online to create your own museum, create your own collection from all of these images.
It's very simple, we walked in, I've created this function that I call "The <unk> <unk> -- we just made a zooming around.
It's about "The <unk> in the National Gallery in London.
You can write things, send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what they feel at contemplating these works <unk>
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all of the amazing things are really really not coming from Google.
No, in my opinion, even they don't come from museums.
Maybe I should not say this.
They actually come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital medium does justice to its work of art, and it's represented properly online.
And the great question they ask me today is, "You do this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk> <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I have something to show you.
Think of it is a <unk> a pixel <unk>
In our lab we call it sensitive design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I am from Italian, <unk> all children in Italy grow with this photo on the wall of your bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that it has happened something very interesting in Formula races one in the last two decades.
So sometime ago, if you wanted to win a career, one of Formula 1, he took a budget and you get it to a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough -- one made a career.
This is what in engineering, it was <unk> in real time.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
What's interesting is that the control systems in real time are starting to get into our lives.
Our cities, over the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics.
They're getting computers to the open.
And as <unk> are starting to respond differently and can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is big.
As a note here, I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the cortex of the planet -- but they represent 50 percent of the <unk> population.
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with the cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond the cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibition of <unk> <unk> for the late MoMA, during the summer.
It's called <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, start <unk>
In a way, it is like almost all of the existing atoms in the back and <unk> and <unk>
And that's changing the interaction that we humans have with the outside environment.
In a sense, it's almost like the old dream of Michelangelo, <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> he said that at the end of it took the hammer -- they actually took the hammer -- you can actually see a little dent in <unk> and he said, "You know, <unk> <unk> <unk> -- and what don't you <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just about <unk> <unk> on the idea of taking the environment and push something.
Let's start with the detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects of our lab.
This was four years ago in Italy.
It was a summer with luck in 2006.
It was the year when Italy got the World Cup in the World.
Maybe some of you remember -- they played Italy and France, and at the end of it, he gave the <unk>
And anyway, eventually I won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day by looking at <unk> activity in the network.
Here's the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the river <unk>
It's the morning before the game.
The line of time is at the top.
At the afternoon early there are people here and there doing <unk>
It starts <unk> silence.
<unk> from France.
<unk> people make a quick call on the bathroom.
Second time. End of time.
First time <unk> second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
Do you win Italy, yeah!
That night everyone went to <unk> the center.
You see the great peak.
The next day everyone went to the center of the winner and the prime minister then.
And then all the world's <unk>
You see the image of the place called <unk> <unk> where, from the time <unk> people are going to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just one example of how you can measure the city rate in a way that we wouldn't have been able to do just a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> is not about people, but things we use and we consume it.
Today we know all about the provenance of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make a Mac, how they are <unk>
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project, we developed some small tags to track the trash in its shift through the system.
We started with a few volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little bit more than a year, to label what they were doing, different kinds of things, as you can see, things that all of all modes of <unk>
Then we put a little chip, a tag on the garbage and then we started <unk>
These are the results <unk>
From <unk>
after a week.
With this information we realized there are a lot of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same with a lot less energy.
These are data that they didn't exist before.
They're going on complicated things and there is a lot of transportation.
But the other thing that we believe is that if you look at every day that the cup that we dropped it is not even somewhere on the planet.
That if the plastic bottle we dropped one day is still there.
If we show that to people, then we can promote some change of behavior.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us a lot more about detecting and lots of other cool things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we talked about at the beginning, which is push over the environment.
And the first project is something that we did a couple of years ago in <unk>
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city, which came and told us that Spain and South Europe have a beautiful tradition of use of water in public spaces in architecture.
And the question was, how can technology, new technology, join that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a workshop was, imagine that they have a <unk> and <unk> valves of <unk> <unk> that open up and <unk>
It believed like a curtain of water, with pixels of water.
If you drop the pixels you can write in them, show patterns, images, texts.
And if you zoom in, the curtain will open up so that we can happen, as you see in the image.
We presented this to the mayor <unk>
He liked it.
And they took a commission to design the building to the entrance to the <unk>
We call it a <unk>
All the building is made of water.
There is no doors and windows and <unk> but when you come up with it to be able to happen.
The roof is also covered in water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> you go down the roof.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture disappears, like this case.
Those days, there will always be somebody, in the winter, when you go down the roof, someone who was there and said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it, but when it comes down almost all the architecture goes down.
Here's how it works.
You look at people who are <unk> by what happens inside.
And here I'm myself trying to do not <unk> the test the sensors that open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened when all the sensors stopped going to work.
That night was actually even more funny.
All the children of <unk> came to the building because the way of interacting had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that would open you to let you happen, but a building that followed <unk> and holes in the water and one had to jump up to not <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us that was really interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think about use people to give our designs?
But then the reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the physical pixels -- the pixels of water, and of projections about them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start to fly.
Imagine that they could have little helicopters in the air and that each one had a small pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, as the one we saw earlier, moving with others in sync.
We could form this cloud,
A kind of flexible screen like this is a normal screen in two dimensions.
Or normal, but in three dimensions, what changes is light, not the position of the pixel position.
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine that the screen appears in different scales and sizes, in different kinds of resolution.
And then all of that could be a cloud of pixels in 3D that you can get closer and forth and see from very different perspectives.
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like before.
When the light turns out, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them by a person.
We can have each pixel with an input that comes from people, the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the world's best dancers in school today, the star <unk> from New York City and the <unk> of <unk> to capture its movements in 3D movements, and use it as input for <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> in different <unk>
It's so much <unk> in real time as it capture.
It can make it all the movement.
You can go through the way.
And once we have the pixels we can play with them, with the color and the movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible input for <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could get people involved in order to do something and change our <unk> environment as an oyster nursery as a <unk> <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine we could make everybody <unk> a little bit for a <unk>
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened in the last couple of years is that, in the last two decades, we go from the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything like knowledge, and it's accessible to the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign is <unk> we can move from the digital world of the power of the power of networks, to the physical world.
In our case, this may we want to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions, how to move from the digital world to the physical world?
The idea is that we can get people involved in doing this together, in a collective way.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the actual cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud they are pixels.
It's a physical structure in London, but covered with the pixel from the pixel on the pixel with the pixel on the pixel with the pixel on the pixel with the pixel on the pixel with the pixel cover.
You can move around, you have different experiences.
You can see from the bottom, serving the main moments of the Olympics of 2012 and even more, and it can be used as a form of connection with the community.
So it's so much a physical cloud of the sky as something that you can go up, like a new top of London.
You can go into there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is to be a new experience for anyone who goes to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than they are.
Suppose I told you that, with just a bit of changes in your genes, you could improve the <unk> for more accurate, and faster.
Or maybe you would like to be in better ways, to be stronger resistance.
Would you like to be more attractive and safer than ourselves?
How about living more with good health?
Or maybe they're in those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What else is they <unk>
What would you like, if you could choose something?
<unk> of the Audience: <unk> <unk>
How many people are <unk> creativity?
Raise your hand. Let me watch.
<unk> probably had the number of creative people.
That's very good.
How many would choose memory?
A few more more.
And the <unk> state.
A little less.
How about <unk>
Oh, most of you. That makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have something about this the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe it's possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> theme here at the TED Conference.
The great paradox of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> that also <unk> in the <unk> Church, <unk> wrote an essay called "No in biology makes sense for the light of <unk>
But if you effectively accept biological evolution consider this: it's just about the past, or the future?
It refers to others or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch right in one end, it is, of course, the most interest of us.
<unk> of a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
There's been maybe 20 or 25 different species of <unk>
Some have gone and <unk>
We've been here about <unk> years.
It might seem that we are far away from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, in its most most basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacterium to produce the protein of the insulin insulin using to treat <unk>
This is not like human insulin -- but it's the same protein, <unk> <unk> of what comes out of the <unk>
And talking about bacteria -- they realize that we all carry in the gut the more bacteria than the cells we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think of -- when Antonio <unk> asks you about <unk> think about <unk>
The gut is a wonderfully controversial environment for those bacteria.
It's hot, dark parallel -- it's very <unk>
And we're going to provide all the nutrients that can want to have no effort out of it.
It really is like a quick pathway for bacteria with the occasional disruption of some rush <unk> towards the <unk>
But therefore we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential for our life.
They help digest nutrients from <unk> and they protect us from certain diseases.
But what does the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or destined to become something different, something maybe better adapted to <unk>
In this vast symphony of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, like one and only <unk> and human life, a little bit of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> of this talk so I hope you have <unk>
When I was just <unk> I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution and realized something fundamental -- in most of the existence of life, in human organisms, every cell just <unk> and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to the two daughters cells.
But when organisms appear -- things start to change.
It goes into the scene the sexual reproduction.
And something very important, with the emergence of sexual reproduction that passes the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you might say that the death of the death of the body goes into evolution at the same moment of sexual reproduction.
I have to tell you that when I was a college student, I thought, well, <unk> <unk> death by <unk> it seemed pretty reasonable at that time, but with every year he was happening, every time I had more <unk>
I came to understand the feelings of George <unk> that still <unk> in Las Vegas well in their 90 years.
And one night someone hits her door <unk>
He opens the door.
In front of him you find a little bit of a little <unk>
He looks at it, and he says, <unk> for a <unk> <unk>
All right, he says, "I choose the <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working on a different target to the goal of <unk> not necessarily <unk> just different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted us to make us healthy.
I wanted to recover health in the disease.
I wanted us to live more and more healthy.
Evolution is going to move the genome to the next <unk> adapted and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary view, you and I are as <unk> rockets designed to send the genetic burden to the next level, and then let us fall into the sea.
I think that all of the <unk> the feeling that put Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to achieve immortality through my work.
I want to <unk> <unk>
Evolution doesn't necessarily contribute to longevity.
They don't necessarily rely on the largest or the stronger or the stronger or the fastest and the most intelligent and even the more smart.
Evolution benefits the best adapted to their environment.
That's the only test of survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean -- the bacteria <unk> that they can survive the heat of the <unk> that <unk> if there were fish there, kind of <unk> fish in the <unk> yet they've managed to make that a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we go back to thinking about the place of humans in evolution and in particular, if we look forward to the <unk> phase -- I would say there are many possibilities.
The first one is that you don't know.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying reasoning would be that through medicine, first of all, we've known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and spread out of the population.
And secondly, as a species, we've got our environment to be adapted to us as well as we adapt to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and we are so scared that it's no longer possible to have the isolation of evolution.
A second possibility is that it is to produce an evolution of the natural kind of traditional traditional kind of dictated by the forces of nature.
And the argument here is, that the gears of evolution roll down, but they're <unk>
And in terms of <unk> when a species -- distant planets, they're going to have the isolation and environmental changes that can produce the evolution in a natural way.
But there's a third possibility -- a <unk> intriguing and scary possibility.
I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not simply <unk> but <unk> and elected for us as individuals in the decisions that we have.
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
So you first consider that many people today, in some cultures, they're making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing having more males than women.
It's not necessarily good for society, but it's what you pick up in the individual and family level.
So think that if you could be able to choose not only to be able to choose not only sex from your <unk> but in your own body to make genetic <unk> to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make genetic change to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminating <unk>
You wouldn't want to make those changes in their genes.
If we look at the future that kind of changes will be more and more possible.
The Human Genome Project started in 1990 and he sued 13 years old.
<unk> <unk> million dollars.
The next year of being done, in 2004, I could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a whole sequence of the three billion base pairs at a cost at about 20,000 and a cost of a week.
It's not a lot to get the human genome to actually make the human genome -- and it's getting more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more
These are those changes.
The same technology that has produced the human insulin resistance can make viruses that are not only going to protect us from themselves, but they're going to <unk> immunity against other viruses.
<unk> or there's no experimental trial in the course of the vaccine against the flu vaccine, in a plant of tobacco plants.
Can you imagine a good thing that comes out of the <unk>
That's actually today and the future is going to be more and more possible.
Imagine then just two little <unk>
They can change the cells in their bodies, but if they could change the cells from their <unk>
And if they could change the sperm and the <unk> or to change the newly <unk> egg and give their children a better chance of a healthy life to remove the diabetes, eliminating <unk> reduce the risk of cancer?
Who does not want to become more <unk>
And then, that same <unk> technology, that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent diseases is going to allow us to also adopt a better memory.
Why don't you have the ingenuity of a Ken <unk> especially if you could be able to do it with the next generation of the <unk> machine.
Why don't you have a <unk> muscle that allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why don't you live more time?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we are in conditions to pass this to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we wanted to have the evolution of before in <unk>
We're going to take a process that normally could take 100 thousand years and we can take it to 1,000 years and maybe happen within the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or the grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have them.
We're going to use these options in order for a better society, more successful <unk>
Or, we're going to choose <unk> different attributes that we want for some of us but not for the others?
We're going to build a society that is more boring, more uniform or more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the most profound thing about everything: we're going to be able to develop wisdom and inherit the wisdom necessary to make these <unk> decisions.
For good or for worse, and before what I could do is that these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big explosion when you're at 900 feet tall.
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine a engine doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> It sounds frightening.
Well, I had a single seat that day. I was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk to the flight.
So immediately, he looked at it, and they said, "No problem. You probably slam some <unk>
The pilot had already been <unk> the airplane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The <unk> pilot with the Hudson River.
Often that's not the road.
<unk> the motors.
Imagine being on a plane and without <unk>
And then he said three words.
Number three words that have heard about.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk more with a flight assistant.
I was able to see it in his eyes.
It was terror. Life is <unk>
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before they die, these things we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people that I wanted to get and didn't do it, all the fences that I wanted to do and I didn't do, all the experiences that I wanted to have and never <unk>
As I thought about that later on, I came up with a sentence, which is <unk> wines <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to open.
I don't want to hear anything in life.
And that urgency, that purpose, has changed my life.
The second thing that I learned is that day -- and this is as I hit the bridge George Washington, which was not for a lot -- I thought about, Wow, I really feel a great <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my mistakes I've tried to get better on everything I did.
But in my humanity I also gave place to my ego.
And I'm sorry for the time that we will get in things that I didn't care about people who matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with the people.
And then, as <unk> in that, I decided to remove the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's a lot better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I'm not trying to have no reason to be <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is how your mental clock is going to be <unk> 14 <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to be <unk> in 20 pieces like you see these <unk>
And while I was <unk> I had the feeling of, Wow, it's not afraid of fear.
It's almost as we've been <unk> for that all of our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to <unk> I love my life.
And that sadness <unk> in a single thought, which is, I just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my children growing.
A month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent --  And I scream, <unk> as a little boy.
And for me, that was the whole reason to be the world.
And at that point I realized those two points, that the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
He gave me a miracle, not to die that day.
And I was awarded another gift, which was the chance to look at the future and go back and live in another way.
You guys are flying in today, the challenge to you to imagine that the same thing happens in your plane -- and please not be that -- but imagine, and how do you <unk>
What is it that <unk> who still expect to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How would your relationships change and the negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they are the best parents that we have.
Thank you.
I've clearly been <unk> in life with many different projects.
But the most great thing that I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the 1980s.
One day came to her house after running and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today, it has total paralysis of it.
It can only use your eyes.
Her job influenced me.
I have a design design and animation and that, obviously, graffiti is a kind of intricate thing that we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
So we decided we were going to go to <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and I met her brother and her father and said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "Just I want to talk to Tony again.
I just want to communicate with him and that he can be able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second -- I said, "A second is not that he <unk> seen Stephen <unk> is not that all people with paralysis can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you're going to be someone important and having a good insurance you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do you communicate then?"
Somebody seen the movie "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate that way, they are <unk> with your finger.
I said, "That's <unk> How could it be?"
So I showed up with the only desire to deliver a check and instead he signed a check that I didn't have the least idea of how I was going to <unk>
I was obsessed with her brother and his father there at that very moment, "All right, this is the <unk> Tony going to talk, we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to do it again.
Because it's ridiculous that someone who has so much in your inside cannot be <unk>
So I talked about a conference a couple months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research who have a technology that allows you to project a light on any surface and then with a laser pointer. draw about that and recorded the negative space.
So you go through making art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, are part of a life cycle.
They start with sexual organs, then with bad words, then with the attacks to Bush and then people start to do art.
But there was always a life cycle in their <unk>
And so it started the journey.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and a lot of organization and so much move things from one side to another we had achieved a couple of things.
One, you touch the doors of the insurance companies and we got a machine so that they could <unk> a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, it's the most <unk> I call him <unk> because when you talk to the guy you get an email from it, and you say, "Don't <unk> this guy -- this guy's great!"
The other thing that we did was to bring seven programmers from all of the world's corners of all the corner of the <unk> to our home.
My wife, the kids and I, we moved to the garage and these hackers and programmers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> they took control of the house.
A lot of our friends thought we were doing something completely stupid and that when they were teaching, they would have removed the frames of the walls and they would have <unk>
But for two weeks old, we went to the round of <unk> my son was part of my dog, and we created this.
It's called <unk> <unk> and you can see the <unk>
This is a couple of <unk> <unk> that we bought in the <unk> <unk> journey and some wire copper and <unk> and Radio <unk>
We took a <unk> camera, we put it up on an LED light, and now there's a device that is free -- and you build a <unk> we published the code <unk> the software goes down to free.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There is no insurance company.
There are no hospital that can say <unk>
Any person with paralysis today has access to drawing and communicate using just your eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks we went back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this is the room of another person, and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great opening.
And then over a year of planning -- two weeks of <unk> <unk> of all night, Tony was drawing for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture, because this is the support system of life and it's looking through the support system.
We ran the bed so that I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall of the parking lot.
And he got to draw for the first time in front of his family and friends -- and you can imagine what the feeling was in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to take in the parking lot, so we feel like we were <unk> graffiti as well.
At the end of this he sent us an email and this was what he said, "This was the first time I draw in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water and someone finally came to <unk> and would get me out there so that I could be <unk>
It's not <unk>
In a way, that's our scream for war.
That's what keeps us in motion, <unk>
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a cool device but it's the equivalent of a <unk>
Someone with this artistic potential deserve much more.
So we are trying to figure out how to <unk> and make it faster and robust.
Since then, we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've gained many prizes.
Remember, one of us are doing money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
<unk> were like, "Oh, this is great!"
Armstrong <unk> something about us, and then, in December, Time magazine recognized us as one of the 50 best inventions of 2010, and it was really cool.
The best thing about all of this -- and this is what ends up of closing the <unk> is that in April of this year in the <unk> of <unk> in the middle of Los Angeles going to be an exhibition called <unk> in the <unk>
And <unk> in <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of urban art, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all of them will be there.
<unk> is going to be on the show which is quite impressive.
So, basically this is my idea: if you see something that's not possible, do it possible.
None of what there is in this room was possible -- the computer, the computer, the microphone, the <unk> -- nothing was possible at a certain time.
Make it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I had never done anything with <unk> <unk> I just recognized something and fascinated me with wonderful people to be able to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want you to all do every day when we find something that we feel like to do. If it's not now, <unk> And if I'm not me, who?
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years in situations usually very difficult and at the same time a dangerous time.
I went to the hard <unk>
I worked in a <unk> mine.
He went in <unk> and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days eating only this fun of the beginning, something difficult in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a lot of my career, I've been involved in situations as horrible as the only goal to try to examine social issues in ways that we have to look at social issues in ways that we have to look at very social issues, and hopefully analyzing in a way that look useful and accessible to the audience.
So when I knew I would come here to do a TEDTalk on the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little different.
So some of you may have heard of it, or not, a couple of weeks ago, I got a <unk> <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I offered the rights of the name of my TEDTalk in 2011.
What I had was like this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it is and according to content, especially if I put it in ridiculous to you or your company to do it.
But I said this, it's a very good opportunity for you.
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a degree in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew somebody was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you had asked me a year ago, a year ago, I would not have been able to do it for certain.
But in the new film that I'm working on, we tested the world of marketing <unk>
And as I said earlier, I've gotten into horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could be able to make it anything that was so difficult to be so difficult to go into the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to make a film that I'm about the <unk> of product -- marketing and advertising, and that the whole film will be <unk> by <unk> marketing and advertising.
The movie is going to call "The largest movie ever <unk>
What happens in "The largest film ever <unk> is that all the top at the bottom, it has images of brand, all the time; from the <unk> that appears before the title of the title, the <unk>
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people were terrified of the film <unk>
And so the film explores all of this idea, <unk> <unk> is <unk> It's <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> It was more for <unk>
It was <unk> <unk>
But we're not just going to have the sponsors of the X mark in the title but we're going to make sure we ate all the categories that we could on the film.
Maybe you get a shoe and you get the most cool shoe that you would have.
The most great car that has driven in the largest film that has led to the largest <unk> ever <unk> the largest drink, <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then besides showing the brands as part of life, making them <unk> the <unk> <unk> making it <unk> the <unk> MS: And we actually show the full process of how it works.
The goal of the film film is transparency.
You'll see the whole process in this movie.
That's the whole idea -- all the <unk> <unk>
And I would love to help me make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that; it's the most respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how to get people to do that.
<unk> You have a <unk> -- I don't know if it's very <unk> but you know how it's going to <unk> David <unk> Don't <unk> David <unk> How much money does it take to do this?
MS: A million and a half <unk> Very <unk> John <unk> I think it's going to be hard with the meeting with them, but it's certainly worth convincing a couple of big markings on it.
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment the movie is going to look at us as a lot of idiots <unk>
MS: What do you think is going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most of the responses will be "No."
MS: But it's going to be hard to <unk> by the film or being I?
JK: Both things.
MS: ... means you're not very optimistic.
And so I <unk> I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> <unk> Awesome.
MK: We need to think about what brands.
MS: Yeah. That's the <unk> when you look at people that you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where to go, <unk> <unk> the camera.
MS: I thought, I thought <unk> <unk> meant we have a conversation out of the microphone.
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so he was, all of these companies suddenly disappeared.
No one wanted to have anything to do with this movie.
I was surprised.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought that the concept of advertising, was to present the product to so many people as possible as possible, so that so many people saw it as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media, and the stage of the separate media, is not the idea to tell that new vehicle that is going to lead the message to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, my idea had a <unk> error and that error was this.
Actually it wasn't such a mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been right.
But the problem was what this image.
See, when you look for images of <unk> in Google <unk>   -- this is one of the first images that appeared.
I like your way to <unk> Sergey Brin: No.
This was the problem: <unk> <unk> or easily <unk> or <unk> or easily <unk> which is characterized by the visibility or access to information, especially in <unk> practices -- being the last line perhaps the biggest problem.
You see, we heard a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> the president -- even the <unk> the <unk>
But all of a sudden when it comes to make it really something that changes suddenly <unk>
But why? Well, the transparency day --  like that weird bear that still continues to <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this rare rural path.
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
It was a <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and to tell them that we wanted to tell this story and said, "No, we want to tell us this story and they said, "No, we want them to be <unk> history.
We want you to take a story, but we want to get a story -- <unk> <unk>
See, when I was a kid, and my father would tell me in some lie -- and there's him looking at me as he used to say, "Son, there are three sides in history.
There's your story, and it's my story, and there's the story <unk>
As you can see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, an agency wanting to help me -- and that just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> of many years -- I realized that I would have to go through my own, I would have to take out of the dream and go to the companies myself.
So what I started to show you suddenly is that when you start talking about the companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make big, big, giant films -- and others who make small, independent films like mine.
And my friends who make Hollywood movies big, giant <unk> say the reason their movies are so successful because of the brands that they have.
And then my friends who make independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, <unk> movie movies.
And the film is called "The largest <unk>
How are we going to look specifically at <unk> in the movie?
Every time I'm going to go out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with someone can say, "You're fine for this <unk>
You ready? You see a little nervous.
I want to help you <unk>
Maybe you should get a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there was one of these <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much for man as a <unk> solid, <unk> <unk> in pole like it.
That's the big look at that.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a look at it.
Karen Frank: We are a small brand.
<unk> the smallest movie in the kind of movie that <unk> are pretty much a <unk> brand.
So we don't have the budget that have other brands.
So doing things like that, you know, remind you to remind people is the reason that this interests us.
MS: What words would use to describe <unk>
<unk> is white.
<unk> That's a great question.
Volunteer: technology.
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put in the <unk>
Man: We talk about a <unk> <unk>
I think it's a great word that actually puts this category in positive versus <unk> the smell and the <unk>
It keeps you.
How do you keep you fresh more time? With better <unk> three times <unk>
Things like those who <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What about a common <unk>
I need to talk to the old man of the street, people like me, <unk> <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do you define you your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like a good clothing.
Woman: revive the '80s, <unk> <unk> unless it's <unk>
MS: All right, what is the brand <unk>
<unk> Something unique. Man: I guess the type of gender, the style I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like a lot of the dark colors, lots of gray and things like that.
Usually I wear horror as <unk> or the <unk> or the <unk>
Woman: If Dan was a brand could be a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The brand I am, I call it <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: In part of <unk> <unk> in part of the <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the type of pets.
<unk> toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my small sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: So my brand is FedEx because he <unk> the <unk>
Man 5: Oh, <unk> <unk>
Is that something?
<unk> I am <unk>
<unk> I'm <unk>
MS: Well, we can't all be a brand Tom, but I often hit the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed someone who could go into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that person's personality.
If they could do it for them, surely they could do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the photos, right?
MS: Yes. The first photo is a familiar picture.
A: Tell me a little bit about how your thoughts relate to your thoughts and feelings your self.
MS: These people shape my way to see the world.
A: Tell me about that world.
MS: So that world? I think your world is the world that we <unk> like the people around you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work that you live in.
All of those things come together, and they start in a place and in my case, and you start in my family, in West Virginia.
A: What's the next thing you want to talk about?
MS: The next one is the best day of my life."
A: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who I'd like to be me.
I like different things.
I like the weird things, I like the weird things.
A: Tell me about <unk> for what is that?
What is <unk> In which phase of <unk> you find you now?
Why is it important? What's the <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
A little bit more of you, it's not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
You don't have to be afraid of what kind of Russian mountain, are you?
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you.)
A: Thank you for your patience. Big <unk> A: Yes. Thank you very much.) All right.
MS: Yes, I don't know what's going to go out of this.
There was a lot of madness in all this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing that I saw was this idea that there are two different sides of it, but <unk> in your personality of <unk> your brand Morgan <unk> is a <unk> brand.
They were <unk> very well together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think that some companies are only embedded in one of your strong points or the other instead of focusing on both.
A lot of companies tend to -- and it's the nature of <unk> to avoid the things that they're not <unk> they avoid fear, those elements and you actually get a little bit of positive to you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are you?
The first here is the classic Apple.
And you can also see here to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are playful marks and brands -- those things that have gone and come in, but a <unk> brand is pretty powerful.
MS: <unk> <unk> What's your <unk>
If someone asks you to give you your identity identity, your personality <unk> what would that be?
You're a <unk> attribute you're someone who makes blood <unk>
Or are you more a <unk> attribute of a <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
The <unk> attributes are like being playful to be cool like <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or audacious <unk> like <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> dominant or mystical like <unk>
Or are you more of <unk> <unk>
You are conscious, as a <unk>
You're a traditional <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You're a <unk> stable, reliable familiar, sure, sacred sacred, or wise one, like the Dalai Lama or <unk>
Over the course of this film we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said <unk> didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mostly because they had no control, they would have no control over the final product.
They allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this film about how we use MRI centers in the brain as much as a movie marketing in the brain as a film for film.
We went to San Francisco, where you have banned advertising to free air.
All the city for the last five years, there's no <unk> there's no <unk> no <unk>
And we went to school districts that companies are getting on the way in schools with money problems in the U.S.
The amazing thing to me is that the projects in which I've had the biggest answer or the ones that I've been more successful is those in which I've interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
They went to their agencies, and they said maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to try and play with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to make people think about people who will challenge the way we look at the world.
And how has it gone? They had success?
Well, since the movie was released in the <unk> <unk> let's take a look.
According to <unk> the film was released in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This covers only a period of two weeks and a half.
That's just in <unk> no press no TV.
The movie is still not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has started to win momentum.
And it's not bad because almost all of the agencies that we talk about telling their customers not to be part.
I have always believed that if you are <unk> if you take risks, that in those risks are opportunity.
I think when you get to the people that are pushing them to failure.
I think when you train your employees at risk aversion is preparing all of your company for <unk> of rewards.
I feel that what has to happen to move forward is that we need to encourage people to <unk>
We need to encourage people to be afraid of the opportunities that they can <unk>
Ultimately, let's move forward, I think we have to give it to the fear.
We need to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear. <unk> risk.
From a <unk> at the time, we have to embrace the risk.
And ultimately, we have to harbor transparency.
Now more than ever a little bit of honesty is going to go a long way.
And I said this, with honesty and transparency, all my <unk> talk -- has been introduced by my good friends of <unk> who for <unk> bought the rights of the name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data in big opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> presents <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: So, <unk> on behalf of transparency, who happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a fantastic question.
In my pocket I have a check on the name of the TED matrix of the TED matrix -- the Foundation Foundation -- a check for <unk> to be applied to my life for the next year.
The idea behind the <unk> computer <unk> is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their highest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the plant of <unk> <unk>
The gray boxes that you see are control of control in real time.
If we can compromise these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with the <unk>
The gray boxes don't use software <unk> they're a completely different technology.
But if we were able to put a cash virus from Windows in a portable computer used by an engineer to set up this gray, <unk> then we're smart.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a <unk>
<unk> enters the gray box, <unk> <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> <unk>
It's easy, <unk>
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started investigating about <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing that I knew is that it's very, very complex at the <unk> of <unk> -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It looked like to want to do something with these dishes, and these control systems.
So that struck us the attention, and we started an experiment in which we had <unk> our environment with <unk> and we saw what happened to this.
So they spent very strange things.
<unk> <unk> like a lab rat who didn't like our <unk> the wave, but I didn't want to eat.
I had no sense for me.
And after experiencing different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, this is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is actively looking at active in the gray box, if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program is trying to infect is actually working on that place:
If not, <unk> does nothing.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what's the <unk>
It could be, let's say for example, a power plant of the United States, or a chemical plant in Germany.
Better than <unk> the goal soon.
And so we pulled up the seizure code, and we found that it was <unk> in two <unk> bombs a small and a big one.
We also saw that they were very professionally armed armed by people who obviously had all the internal information.
They would get all the points to attack.
They probably even know how much the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that <unk> <unk> is complex and high technology, let me say, the payload is very complex.
It's very above everything we've seen before.
So here you see a sample of this code.
We're talking about 15,000 lines of code.
It looks like old language <unk>
I want to tell you how we could find sense to this code.
What we were looking for at the beginning were called the functions of the system, because we know what they do.
Then we were looking for <unk> and <unk> structures and tried to <unk> with the real world with potential goals in the real world.
We need theories about <unk> that we can pass or <unk>
To get to theories about goals, we remember that it's definitely a violent <unk> and it's likely to be located in Iran, because it's where most of the infections has been <unk>
They don't find several thousand targets in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant of <unk> and to the <unk> plant.
So I told my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and the energy plants between our <unk>
I called them and I went back to an effort for <unk> their experience with what we find on code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with the control of <unk>
<unk> is that mobile part within the <unk> that black object that you see.
If they run the speed of this <unk> they can certainly <unk> and even make it <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and <unk> in an effort to go back to the nest engineers so that they couldn't solve this quickly.
We're trying to decipher the big digital <unk> looking at the data and their structures.
So for example, the number <unk> <unk> in that code, you can't <unk>
I started looking at scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they are <unk> in what's called a <unk> and every waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
That made sense, there was a coincidence.
And it was better than yet.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what about <unk>
A <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had in the hands.
So it wasn't <unk> it wasn't like this.
The results have been made after several weeks of hard work.
<unk> <unk> on dead ends.
Yet, we found that both digital <unk> pointed at one and just goal, but from different perspectives.
<unk> <unk> is taking a <unk> and making <unk> and <unk> and the big <unk> communicates with six <unk> and manipulating it.
In <unk> we're very confident that we have determined which is the <unk>
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We should not care about other goals that are <unk> by <unk>
So here I show you a few very interesting things that we saw -- I really hated me.
There's the grey box, and the <unk> you see the <unk>
What this thing does is they intercept the input values of sensors for example, from the pressure sensors and the vibration of vibration and provides the <unk> which still runs during the attack, with false password data.
And believe it or not, these fake input data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like the Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera is <unk>
It's great <unk>
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> to the operators in the room of control.
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act fast.
For example, in a energy plant, when the large steam turbine is <unk> you have to open valves escape in a <unk>
Obviously, this can't do it a human operator, you can't do this.
That's where we need digital security systems.
And when they're <unk> then you can get bad things.
The plant can <unk>
And the <unk> and the security system is <unk>
That scares me.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
It has nothing to see, specifically, with <unk> with <unk> <unk>
It could work too, for example, in a energy plant, or a factory factory.
It's <unk>
And you don't have <unk> that will disseminate this burden with a <unk> key, as we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional technology for <unk>
It was more possible.
And if you made that, with what you're going to do is with a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence that we face.
Unfortunately, the largest number of targets for such attacks are not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and in Japan.
All the green areas are spaces with a lot of goals.
We need to deal with the consequences and better than we start making it now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has done public in many sides that people assumed that <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What is your <unk>
Ralph <unk> OK, you really want to hear this?
Yeah. <unk>
My opinion is that the <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the <unk> superpower here.
There's one alone, and that's the United States, fortunately, <unk>
Because otherwise our problems would be even larger.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
I want you to imagine a robot that can be able to take and give you <unk> abilities or another one that makes chairs from wheels and get back to walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
They're not different from something that you put in the morning, gives you a great force -- that also increases your speed, and help, for example, drive the balance.
It's actually the real integration of man and machine.
But not only that -- it can integrate and connect it with the universe and with other things.
This is not a <unk> idea.
To show you now what we're working on, we started talking about the American soldier who, on average, you have to take on their back a <unk> charge of 45 pounds, and it's <unk> to get more team.
Obviously, this leads to some major complications in injuries at the back, at 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic <unk>
We decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help drive the matter.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> or <unk> <unk> Human Man.
Soldier: With the exoskeleton <unk> I can save 90 pounds of data for many hours.
Their flexible design, it allows you to <unk> <unk> and run with great <unk>
So I think of what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then my strength goes up and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
Let's go back and look at the users of <unk> on what I'm particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people here in the ground, all over the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens very often, a very young people with damage to the backbone that when their life will start their life -- to the 20, 30 or 40 years -- they collide with a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only option.
We also talk about the population that <unk> which is blown up very quickly.
His only option, many times -- by a brain injury or some <unk> -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been this for the last 500 years, from the successful <unk> as I should recognize.
So we decided to start by writing a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who was 19 years ago he had an injury on the neocortical column, and as a result couldn't go back to walk 19 years now.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB:
It has some sensors.
Not <unk> in crutches that send signals to the computer on board, here on the back.
There are a couple of batteries that give the motors into the <unk> and on the knees, and they make it forward with this soft and very nature.
AB: I was 24 at the top of my life when, for a strange leap in the air, skiing down it was <unk>
In a fraction of a second, I lost all feeling and all of the <unk> movement down.
Shortly later, a doctor walked into my room in the hospital, and he said, <unk> you never come back to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So I stole up to the last little bit of hope of my self.
<unk> technology since then, has allowed me to learn how to <unk> it costs the rocks down and even riding rocks and even riding <unk>
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, so far.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change the future of future generations -- not only by soldiers, but Amanda, and all of the users of <unk> to everybody.
AB: Thank you.
I've just returned from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> practice sex to say hi, and the game is the order of the day -- where fun is serious.
And no, it's not the <unk> festival or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, you know about their cousins.
This is the world of the <unk> of rainforests in Congo.
The Bonobos are along with chimpanzees, their closest living communities.
That means that we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother that lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimpanzees are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've done too much emphasis on this aspect of our narratives of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas chimpanzees are dominated by the big type, <unk> society Bonobo is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special -- because this leads to a very tolerant society, where mortal violence is still not <unk>
But unfortunately, the Bonobos are the least <unk> of the great apes.
They live in the depths of the rainforest, and it's been very difficult to <unk>
Congo is a <unk> a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> scenario in a violent conflict that has been funded by decades and caused almost as many deaths as the First World War.
No wonder that the destruction is also putting in danger the survival of the Bonobo.
The trade of hunting and deforestation makes you not be able to fill up a stadium or the Bonobos who are in the world -- and honestly, we're not safe to it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos, you can hear the hidden laughter <unk> the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know them like apes -- the love, not the <unk> because they have sex frequent <unk> <unk> and <unk> to manage conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of Bonobos is more than <unk> <unk>
<unk> as humans, they love to play throughout their lifetime.
Play is not just a game game.
For us and for them, the game is fundamental to establish bonds and foster <unk>
We learn <unk> and we learn the rules of the game.
The game increases creativity and resilience and has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of behaviors, diversity of connections.
And when you look at the game Bonobo you see the roots in the same side of laughter, the dance and the human ritual,
The game is the glue that came together.
I don't know how you play you, but I want to show you a couple of only a single <unk> <unk>
First, it's a <unk> <unk> game, and I don't talk about football.
Here's a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look at what's doing it.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, <unk> has a <unk>
I just believe that in this case to him, right?
Yeah.
So sexual game is common both in Bonobos as in humans.
And this video is really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements in the game -- like the <unk> and also how the game requires trust and <unk> and at the same time is the most fun.
But play is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can adopt many ways, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> maybe the place where the wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is <unk> a young female who's playing with a <unk>
I think, as it, sometimes we played ourselves, and we explore the limits of our inner worlds and outside.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, to interact. And then the unexpected connections that we form are the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just small samples of understanding that Bonobos give us our past and present.
But they also have a secret to our future, a future where we have to adapt to a more and more difficult world with greater creativity and more cooperation.
The secret is that the game is the key to these abilities.
In other words, the game is our <unk> of <unk>
To adapt to a world that changes we have to play.
But let's take the maximum of our game?
The game is not <unk>
The game is essential.
For Bonobos and humans in the same way, it's not just cruel and <unk>
When it seems at least appropriate to play, they can be the moments in which it is the most urgent thing.
And so, fellow primates, let's accept this gift of evolution and play together as we choose creativity, the friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I'm responsible for a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I am not fighting the poverty, <unk> fires as a captain of captain in a fire body.
And in our city, where volunteers include a highly skilled staff -- you have to get to the fire site very soon to get into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so he had a pretty high probability of going.
But there was still a race against the other volunteers to get the captain to the captain and figure out what our task was.
When I found the <unk> he was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that certainly went through one of the worst days of his life.
We were at full night, she was standing out of the rain, under a <unk> in his pajamas and <unk> while his house was on fire.
The other volunteer that I had just arrived before me, <unk> <unk> <unk> --  came first to the captain and he asked him to fit in and would save the owner of the house.
<unk> I was <unk> <unk>
So there was a lawyer or a <unk> of money who, during the rest of his life, I would have to tell the people who entered a <unk> building to save a live -- just because I won for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need between the house.
I need you to <unk> the fire, and he brings this woman a pair of shoes."
I <unk>
It wasn't exactly what I expected but <unk> I got on the stairs, at the end of the hall, I went to the fire firemen that at the top or they had finished the fire and walked into the main room for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my payload back to the staircase where I met my <unk> and the precious dog on the front door, and the <unk>
I went from the house of the house for the house owner where, as you would expect, his trove got a lot more attention than mine.
A few weeks later the department received a letter from the owner of the house owner.
The kindness that she looked at was that someone had ever reached a pair of shoes.
And so much in my calling in Robin <unk> as in my calling as my calling of generosity -- I'm witness to acts of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also acts of acts and courage to the individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So when I look at this room to people who have done it, or they're by doing it -- remarkable levels of success would like to remind you to remind you this: I don't know.
Don't wait for the first one million to make the difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give, you want to get it now.
<unk> food in a dining room, <unk> a neighborhood park.
They're mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save someone else's life, but every day we're going to be able to influence someone's life.
So you enter the <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a big fan of the concrete block.
The first concrete blocks was built in <unk> with a very simple idea of cement modules in a fixed measure that fit each other.
Very quickly, these became the most used unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build things bigger than us, as buildings or bridges a brick at a time.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, <unk> came up with this.
He was called <unk> <unk>
And in a few years, the <unk> bricks came to every home.
It's estimated that they have been over 400 billion or 75 bricks per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges, buildings or houses.
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> simply adopted the concrete block in the world, and it became a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the Bell, Bell, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new building block.
The transistor was a small unit of plastic that would take us from a world of <unk> <unk> piled on each other to a world where everything was interactive.
Like the concrete block -- the transistor allows you to create a much bigger and more complex circuits and a brick at a time.
But there's a <unk> <unk> the transistor was just for experts.
I personally don't believe that the building blocks of our time are turning to experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I started to explore the idea of bringing the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started to develop <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronic modules each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best thing about everything is that they come together by scale.
So you can't place it in the wrong way.
<unk> have a code of colors.
The green is, the blue is the stream, the pink is the input and the orange color is the wire.
So you only have to put together a blue with a green one, and very quickly you can start to make bigger circuits.
A blue with a green one with a green one.
Can we put a button in the middle and then we have a <unk>
If we change the button for a pulse, which is here, and now we have a <unk> light.
And we had this <unk> to create more impact and we have a computer machine.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to program, connect and <unk> <unk> allows us to program using very simple gestures.
To make <unk> faster or slower <unk> just turn this button that makes your pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's a full collection.
We want all the interactions in the world to move into bricks and ready to use.
<unk> sound, solar panels must all be accessible.
We've given the kids to see them playing with them.
And it's been an amazing experience.
The best thing is how they start to understand the electronics of every day that you don't learn in schools.
For example, how does a light at night, or why the door of an elevator is held open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We also have led to design schools.
So for example, designers without some electronic experience begin to play with <unk> as a material.
Here you can see, with paper bottles and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
<unk> --  ago, a few weeks ago, we took the designers from the Rhode Island School of Rhode Island, who have no experience in engineering, just in wood and paper and said, Make something like something.
Here's an example of a project that have done a <unk> of <unk> <unk>
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> which is a fear of darkness.
For these not engineers, <unk> became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to all of us all.
So <unk> has open source.
You can visit the website, you download all the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world we live in, this interactive world, is ours.
So forward and <unk>
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you today about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar industry.
And my little company is looking for engaging with the environment to focus on.
We distributed collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> Wait a moment.
You can take a little bit of <unk>
We can continue to better let the video on one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
The solar technology is ...
Oh, I heard the time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, I launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represent almost everything that we are supposed to work on, we asked them to work in government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like a <unk> Peace <unk>
We had a few members every year, and we put them working with the <unk>
Instead of <unk> the Third World we send them to the wild world.
They made great <unk> worked with the employees who were <unk>
Their task is to show the possibilities of technology today.
<unk> <unk>
It's a hydrant in the city of Boston.
Here it appears as if I would find a quote, but what you really look for is that somebody else is caught by the snow, because it knows it's not very good by turning fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did it come to ask for help in this <unk> way.
Last year in Boston we had a team of members of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at that moment -- a lot of last year.
They realized that the city never wiped these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> noticed something else else -- that citizens will be able to <unk> the sidewalks right in front of them.
So it did like any good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice application where you can take a <unk>
You accept <unk> when you <unk>
When you do that, you put a name, in this case he put him <unk>
If you don't do, someone can be <unk>
I mean, it has a component uprising.
It's a modest application.
Maybe it's the smallest of the 21 applications -- last year.
But it does something that no other technology of the government <unk>
And it spreads viral.
A responsible for systems in the city of <unk> when you see this app that I could use it, not for the snow, but for citizens to make <unk>
It's very important to work these <unk> of tsunami, but people are <unk> the batteries.
So why is the citizens that <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make citizens <unk> <unk>
And Chicago has just been <unk> to get people to get together to clean sidewalks in the time.
So now we know about nine cities that will be able to use it.
And this has been spreading <unk> in a natural and natural way.
If you know a little government technology will know that this doesn't happen yet.
The software acquisition usually takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool that parents could choose the best public school for their children.
And then they told us that he had done it by normal channels would have taken at least two and three million dollars.
And that's nothing.
Now there is a project in the head of California that even time has passed, 2,000 million dollars and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this in every level of government.
So an app that has program in a couple of days and it spreads in a viral form is a kind of throwing warning to the institution of government.
It suggests the best way to work, not as in private companies as many people think it should be.
Not as a technological company, it's more like the Internet itself.
I mean, without constraints, in the form of open and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way to address the question of government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an <unk> institution, but as a collective action problem.
And that's very good because it turns out we're very good for the collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools to make them together with efficacy.
And it's not only <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people around the country that contribute to <unk> apps every day in their own communities.
They've not been given to the government.
Do you feel a great frustration in that but they don't get <unk>
And these people know something that we've lost from view.
And it is that if we stop the feelings about politics, the row in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all of those other things that put us crazy -- the government is essentially in the words of Tim <unk> what we do together because they didn't get <unk>
Now, a lot of people have abandoned the government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to do it, because things are changing.
The politics don't <unk> the government.
And because the government ultimately made up of us -- remember that of <unk> the <unk> the way of thinking about it will affect the way to produce change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought the government was to choose people to make them <unk>
Well, after two years, I have come to the conclusion that the government is mostly about <unk>
This is the center of health care and information center.
It's the place that serves the calls if you mark them in the U.S.
Scott <unk> this call.
He stood in the basis of official knowledge.
I didn't find anything. It started with animal control.
And he finally said, "Hey, you can open the doors of the house, and you will have good music and see if you are."
And it worked. So by Scott.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston doesn't have a telephone center.
It has a <unk> and mobile application, called <unk> <unk>
We don't know that app.
It was the work of very smart people from the Office of New York City <unk>
And one day, this actually comes up with this <unk> <unk> in my trash. I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do for <unk>
<unk> dynamics is different.
Scott was talking in person.
In <unk> <unk> everything is public, so everyone can see this.
In this case, it saw a neighbor.
The next report, he said, "I came up to the place, I found the cube behind the house.
<unk> Yes. <unk> Yes.
I went back the <unk> I went home.
Good nights, <unk>
Quite simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of the digital and the physical.
And it's also a great example of the government of government to the distributed volunteer facility.
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the definition technology of platform.
I'm talking about a platform for people to get sick and help others.
So, a citizen helped another but here the government had a key role.
connected two people.
And it could have connected to the government services of being necessary but the neighbor is a better alternative and cheaper alternative than the government services.
When one neighbor helps you to make the communities.
If we call control animals, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing we need to think about government is that it's not the same as the politics.
A lot of people do it, but think you're the entry of the other.
So our entry to the government system is the vote.
How many times have you chosen a political leader, sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader, and then we hope that the government will embrace our values and we need our needs, but then we don't see changes.
That is because the government is like an immense ocean and politics is the <unk> shallow layer.
It's below what we call <unk>
And we say that word very contempt.
But it is that <unk> what keeps that out of that that we funded as something that is working on our against.
People believe that politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work, we will have to get the bureaucracy to be sexy.
Because that's where the real work of government.
We need to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the movement <unk>
They've got them.
It's a group of citizens worried that they have written a very detailed report of 325 pages in response to the order of <unk> <unk> about the financial reform project.
That's not a political activism -- it's <unk>
And for those of us who have <unk> us to the government, it's time we ask ourselves, what world we want to leave with our children.
You have to see the big challenges that they will have to face.
Do you really believe that we're going to get to where we have to go without solving the institution that can act on <unk>
We can't do without government, we need it to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology as we can rethink the root function of government so that it can be expanded by civil society.
There's a generation that grew up with the Internet and it knows that it's not so hard to act <unk> we only have to articulate the systems in the right way.
The age of our members of our members is 28 years old, so I -- I'm a bigger generation than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up by taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who is going to <unk> you're all going to talk.
They can express their views in any channel at the same time and they do.
So when they face the government problem, they don't really care about to make their voices.
They're using your hands.
They lay the work to the work to program applications that make it work better to the government.
And those applications allow us to use our hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning up a <unk> pulling out <unk> dumping you a garbage cube that has a <unk> inside.
Of course, we could always have cleaned up those <unk> and a lot of people do.
But these applications are like digital <unk> that we're not only consumers, we're not only consumer consumers that we pay taxes and we get services.
We are more than that: we are citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until they don't get the <unk>
So I want to ask all of you, when it comes to the important things that we have to do together, all together, we will be a crowd of voices, or we will also be a swarm of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in the prisons.
I've spent most of my life in the communities that are involved in projects and places where there's a lot of despair.
And I'm here at TED watching and hearing these <unk> has given a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time is that TED has identity.
And the things that are saying here have impact around the world.
In occasions, if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that would not have another way.
I say this because I think identity is <unk> important.
Here we've seen fantastic presentations here.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can make a lot of sense, but if you teach them with feeling, they can have a special meaning.
A doctor can do good, <unk> if it's <unk> it can get a lot more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't really learn this in the law of the law, my job.
I learned it from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of a family <unk> dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was hard, it was strong, had power.
It was the last word in the family.
She <unk> many of the <unk> in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in slavery in Virginia about <unk>
She was born about the <unk> and his experience with slavery was <unk> the way the world looked like.
She was hard, but it was also <unk>
When I was a little bit and I looked at it, she was approaching me and gave me a good hug.
I was so strong that I was barely able to breathe and then I got off.
One or two hours later, I would come back to <unk> and I said, <unk> you still feel my <unk>
And if he said no, I was going to get it back again, and if he said yes, I was left in peace.
He had this human quality that would always want to be close to it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the lowest of 10.
At occasions, when I was going to spend a time with it, it wasn't easy to capture your time and your attention.
My cousins were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight -- nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went to the room, and there were all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
I thought it was a game.
And then he looked at him, and she was <unk> but she was very serious.
After 15  20 minutes, she stood up, went through the room, and he said, "Come on. The two are going to <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
He took me outside and said, "You know, I'll tell you something, but you can't tell you <unk>
I said, "Okay, <unk>
She said, "Now <unk> I didn't, I said, "Sure."
Then I sat down, and he looked at me and said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you want.
I'll never forget it.
Then he said, "Just do I want you to give me three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "I first want you to tell me that we always want your mother."
<unk> "She is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that always <unk>
As I went to my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> I was <unk>
Then he said, "The second thing I want you to tell me, is that you're always going to do the right thing if the right thing is <unk>
I thought about it, and I said, "Yes, <unk>
Then finally he said, "The third thing I want you to tell me, is that you never want to <unk>
And I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> so <unk>
I grew up in the field, in South rural. I have a brother a bigger year and a sister a small year.
When I was 14  15, my brother came home with a <unk> package -- I don't know where the <unk> grabbed my sister and I went to the forest.
We just came up with the <unk>
He took a sip of beer, he took my sister, she took a little bit and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. It's okay. You <unk> but I'm not going to take you <unk>
My brother said, <unk> <unk> And you always do the same thing as we are.
I already took something, your sister as well.
I said, "No, I wouldn't feel good, you can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me.
And he said, "What happens? Take a <unk>
I landed the look with a force and <unk> "Oh, not that you're still thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something you probably shouldn't say.
I know this is spreading <unk>
But I have 52 years old, and I can admit that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I don't mean this thinking that it's a <unk> I say it for the power of identity.
When we create the right kind of identity, we say things to others that they really don't think of meaning.
We can't get to do things that you don't believe being able to do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been a prisoner during the <unk>
My uncles died from age-related diseases.
And these were the things that, according to it, we should <unk>
Now, try to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is very different than it was 40 years ago.
<unk> 300,000 prisoners.
There's 2.3 million.
In America we have the largest incarceration rate in the world.
We have seven million people on parole.
And this massive incarceration in my opinion, has changed fundamentally our world.
In poor communities or black, you find so much <unk> so much despair, by these facts.
One in three black men between the 18 and the 30 years is in prison or <unk>
In urban <unk> all over the country, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Baltimore, 50 to 60 percent of all the young people of color are in prison or by parole.
Our system is not only distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a judicial system that makes you much better if you're rich and guilty.
It's not <unk> but wealth is affecting the results.
And it seems that we feel very <unk>
The fear of fear and anger makes us believe that these are not problems.
We are <unk>
It seems interesting.
We're looking at our work some things well curious.
In my state, in Alabama, as well as other states, you give you rights to always if you have a criminal <unk>
Right now in Alabama, the <unk> of the black population has lost the right to vote.
And if we projected it to the next 10 years the level of rights to be as high as it was before it was before it was before it was before it was before it was before it was before it was before it was before it was before it was before it was before it was before it was before it was before it was before it was before
We have this awesome silence.
I represent children.
A lot of my customers are very young.
America is the only country in the world where it was passed to 13 years to die in prison.
We have in this country in prison, no possibility of getting out there.
Now we're in the process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
Tell people in the death row.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
And in a sense, you've got to think that the final question is, people deserve to die by <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think of another way about how we are in our identity.
There's another way of <unk> it is not about deciding whether people deserve to die for <unk> but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
The death penalty in America is defined by mistake.
Out of every nine thousand people have identified that it's innocent and liberated from the death <unk>
An error, <unk> an innocent rate of every nine.
This is interesting.
And in aviation would not be allowed to ever be able to fly airplanes if every nine people would have <unk> you would have <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our fight.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of whether we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students about <unk> history, I talk about slavery,
I talk about terror, the time that started at the end of the reconstruction of the rebuilding and that was to the Second World War.
We really don't know a lot about this.
But for the black Americans in this country, it was a bit defined by terror.
In many communities people were afraid to be <unk>
They were worried about being <unk>
The threat of terror was what defined his lives.
Now there are more people who come to me and say, <unk> Stevenson, you count talks, makes people <unk> <unk> people who stop saying that in our history we deal with the first time with terror, after <unk>
They ask me to say, "No. <unk> we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism went on, obviously, with segregation and decades of that racial and <unk>
In this country we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
All of the time <unk> one with each other.
We constantly create tensions and conflict.
It costs us to talk about sentences, I think it's because we're not willing to engage us with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that they couldn't overcome the <unk> of a commitment to truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany giving talks about death row.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said, "Do you know that it's good enough to listen to what you want.
<unk> "We have no death row in Germany.
We will never have it here."
The room stood silently and a lady said, "There's no way to our story, we can never get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we <unk> and <unk> we would put up to <unk>
<unk> about this.
How would we feel like a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> people, especially if they were in their most <unk>
We couldn't afford it.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there is this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we don't really care about these very difficult issues, the positive things and wonderful things are, however, <unk>
We love innovation.
We are fascinated by technology. <unk> creativity.
We love entertainment.
But recently, those realities are <unk> by suffering, the abuse, the <unk> the <unk>
In my view, you need to integrate both things.
lately we've talked about the need to have more hope, more commitment, more dedication with the basic challenges of this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor, the ones that will never come to TED.
And if you think of them is, in a way, something that is inside our self.
It's true that we have to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are. Even though we are so rational, so committed to the intellectual thing.
With innovation, with creativity -- development is not just about brain ideas.
These things come from ideas that come from the heart of the heart.
This connection of the mind with the heart is what drives us to look at not just the brilliant and <unk> but also in the dark and the hard thing.
<unk> <unk> the great leader was talking about this.
He said, "When we were in the East Europe, suffering from <unk> we wanted all sorts of things, but mainly what we needed was hope, orientation for spirit, an willingness to be in despair and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much in the heart of what I think, even in communities like TED, must be <unk>
There's no disconnect related to technology and design, that allows us to be truly humans if we don't pay attention to poverty, to the <unk> to inequality, to injustice.
Now I want to warn you that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity than we are ignoring these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege, being a very young lawyer from meeting Rosa <unk>
These women were together, just to speak.
Occasionally, the lunch lady called me to say, "You know, <unk> comes the <unk>
Do you want to come and <unk>
I would say, "Yes, lady. I do."
So she said, "Well, what are you going to do when you <unk>
I said, <unk>
So I was going and just <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And at one occasion, I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple of hours, Ms. Parks went to me and said, "Now, <unk> tell me that this idea of justice <unk>
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started to give my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been convicted <unk>
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in the management of criminal justice.
We try to end up with the sentences of life, without freedom for children.
We try to do something about death worth of death.
We try to reduce the population in prisons.
We try to end up with the <unk> <unk>
I gave it all my best speech, and he looked at me and said, "You know, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
At that moment, Mrs. <unk> got my finger on the face and said, "This is why you have to be very much, but very <unk>
I think actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to find the way to deal with those challenges, those issues, that suffering.
Because eventually humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated in simple things.
I've come to understand and to believe that each one of us is higher to the worst thing that we have ever seen.
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie, it's not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if someone takes something that doesn't blame you, it's not a <unk>
Even if someone kills another, it's not that it's a <unk>
This is why I think there's a basic dignity in the people who must be <unk> by law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country, and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
That's not.
I really think that in many parts the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I believe that even though it's very beautiful, very <unk> very <unk> that we are not going to judge us for our technology, for our designs, or our intellectual capacity or rational.
By the end of a society, the character of a society, not because of the way they treat rich and powerful people, but because of the way they treat the poor, they are afraid of prisoners.
Because it is in this context as we started to understand really profound issues about what we are.
Sometimes I feel <unk> I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I do a lot of force.
<unk> tired, <unk>
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in a very important way.
I've been representing these guys who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to prison and I see my customers of 13 and 14 years old, who have been <unk> so that they were <unk>
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge turn to someone who is not it?
The judge would be described as an adult, but I see a child.
One night too late he was awake -- <unk> for God, if the judge can turn you into something that you don't are, must have magical powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magical powers.
You should ask some of that.
As it was very late, I couldn't think right, but I started working on a <unk>
He had a <unk> customer -- a small, poor, black.
I started working on <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> for my <unk> black client was treated like a privileged white <unk> executive from a <unk>
In the <unk> I put there there was a <unk> behavior in the <unk> in the behavior of the police and in the process.
There was a <unk> line, about how in this country there is no ethical and a whole lack of ethics.
The next morning I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream, or a really <unk>
For my horror, there was not only <unk> but he had sent it to court.
It took about two months, I had forgotten it.
And eventually <unk> Oh God, I have to go through this case stupid.
I got into the car and I felt really <unk> <unk>
I was in the car to court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
And eventually I went down from the car. He walked into court.
I was going up the stairs when I found myself with a black man <unk> was the <unk> of court.
When he saw me, he came up to me and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> He said, "It's you. I said yes.
So I came up with me and I was shocked.
And I stood up in the ear.
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That's deeply connected with my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went to the room.
When I came in, the judge saw me.
He said, <unk> Stevenson, you wrote this bold <unk>
I said, "Yes, Mr. <unk> I started going forward.
People started there. They were all <unk>
I was the one that had written those <unk>
They got the policemen and the prosecutors -- no good <unk>
Suddenly, without knowing how, the room was full of people. All right, because we talked about races, because we talked about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye, I got to see the <unk> which was going and <unk>
I would just look through the window and try to hear all that <unk>
<unk> walking over here and there.
Finally, this old black man, in the face of concern, I entered the room and sat behind me, almost on the lawyers.
Ten minutes later, the Justice <unk> a <unk>
And during the break a <unk> assistant showed me upset because the <unk> had entered the room.
The assistant over the old black <unk>
And he said, <unk> what do you do in the <unk>
And the old black man stood up and looked at me and he looked at me and said, <unk> this audience of audiences to tell this young man who maintain his view in the target with <unk>
I've come to TED today, because I think a lot of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it folds up to justice.
That we cannot be truly human <unk> if we don't care about human rights, and for dignity.
That our survival is linked to each other.
That our visions of technology, design, entertainment and creativity must be <unk> by <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, those of us who share this, I just want to tell you that keep the view in the target with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Talk to hear and see an obvious desire in the audience of this community, to help in your purposes of doing something.
Something that's not a check. What can we do?
<unk> There are several opportunities nearby.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which you will make an effort to take care of the funds that are spending today in math policies.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars on death row in the next five years. A billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of the murder cases of murder is not <unk> in <unk>
The <unk> of rapes don't get at all.
Here's an opportunity for change.
This <unk> is going to propose that these funds are going to get the law to make security.
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in <unk> in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, is that it has to do with the highest rate of <unk>
What would you say to those who believe that this is?
<unk> Actually, the rate of <unk> with violence has remained relatively stable.
The big growth in mass <unk> in this country is not for crimes with violence.
It's by the wrong war war.
That's why this dramatic increase in the population will happen.
And we let us convince the rhetoric of the punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people to chain for stealing a bicycle, by small crimes against ownership instead of making them <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we need to do more to help victims of <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy about punishment does nothing for anybody.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> you've got us excited about today here.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.
<unk> <unk> the threats about Bin Laden.

Oh, my God!
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips that I got in the last six months.
The idea is that media media prefer <unk> negative news, because our minds pay attention to you.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of every day our senses are getting a lot more data than probably the brain can <unk>
And like nothing else to survive, the first stop of all that data is an old fragment of the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning detector, the <unk>
<unk> and records all the information looking for something in the environment that could do harm.
So from a <unk> of stories, looking at the negative.
That old adage from the <unk> "If there's blood -- it's very true.
And because all digital devices give us negative news -- the seven days of the week, 24 days a day -- no wonder that we are <unk>
It's not surprising that people think the world is going to be wrong with worse.
But maybe it doesn't.
Maybe instead, what is really happening is that we got <unk>
Perhaps the enormous progress done in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so that we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems -- climate change, the <unk> of the species, the scarcity of water and <unk> without doubt we have.
As human beings are very good at <unk> and in the long time, we just have them.
<unk> then what happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average life is more than <unk> per capita income per capita by inflation has <unk> across the world.
Child mortality has reduced 10 times.
In addition, the cost of food, of transportation and communications, has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we are living the most peaceful age of human history.
And Charles <unk> that global literacy went from 25 to more than 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people will do it.
And we continue to embrace it every time higher <unk>
In fact, they <unk> the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in the U.S., a lot of the people who live under the poverty line has electricity, they have electricity, they have electricity, they have TV, and it's over, air conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the rubber century, the <unk> on the planet, would never have dreamed of such <unk>
It was a lot of this technology and <unk> its exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that <unk> in the information technology jumps into this curve, Moore's Law, and double the performance of the price at about 12 to 24 months.
For that reason the mobile phone is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer for the '70s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things on this curve.
First, the soft thing that's -- in good and bad time in war and peace, in recession, in depression and <unk>
It's the amount of computer computers used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop for any of the great challenges.
And although it's <unk> on a law on the left, it curve goes up.
The growth rate of technology is actually getting faster.
And in this curve, to <unk> from Moore's Law, there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we have today.
The computation in the cloud, that my friends from <unk> are called infinite computing and sensors and networks, 3D printing and its ability to democratize and distribute personalized production across the planet, synthetic biology, the fuels and the food and the food and the digital medicine, the <unk> and the <unk>
I mean, how many saw the victory of Watson, of <unk>
It was <unk>
I was looking at the newspapers the best headline to <unk>
And I loved this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
Play with the <unk> of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence on the cloud, available for all of the mobile phone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new college called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can you be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a service or service, that can positively affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact the lives of a billion people.
Thirty years ago, that would have <unk> absurd.
Today we can point now a <unk> of companies that have already done.
When I think about creating abundance, it doesn't mean to create life in the planet -- it's about creating a life of what possible.
It's about taking that is <unk> and making it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of Napoleon <unk>
He's the guy on the left.
<unk> the king of <unk>
<unk> troops ate with <unk> and the same <unk> with gold <unk>
But the king of <unk> ate with <unk>
You see, the aluminum was the most valuable metal in the planet, was more than gold and <unk>
For that reason the tip of the Washington Washington Washington is <unk>
You see, although aluminum is the <unk> of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come as a <unk>
It's tied to oxygen and <unk>
But then he got the <unk> and he made the aluminum something so cheap that we use it as if it was <unk>
<unk> this analogy to the future.
Let's think about energy scarcity.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're on a planet by 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They come to the Earth 16 <unk> of energy every 88 minutes.
It's not about whether it's <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar power in India is 50 percent less than the produced by <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar energy fell 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that in the end of the decade, in the U.S. parts of the United States, solar electricity will cost six cents a <unk> for the age of 15 cents in national average.
And if we have abundance of energy, we also have water abundance as well.
Let's talk about the wars in the water.
Remember when Carl Sagan pointed at the Voyager spacecraft to the Earth, in 1990, after it was <unk>
<unk> a famous picture, how do you get <unk>
"A pale <unk>
Because we live on a water planet.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent of water.
Yes, <unk> water is saltwater, two percent of ice is ice, and we <unk> the water <unk> of the planet, but there is a hope.
It's a technology available not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes the nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators from <unk> I'd like to share with you for you permission to get your technology called <unk> <unk> <unk> -- it's the size of a small refrigerator size.
It is able to generate a thousand liters of drinking water to the day of any source -- <unk> water, <unk> water -- by less than two cents a gallon.
The president of Coca-Cola is just thought that I'm going to do a significant test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes right, and I have full confidence in which this will be, Coca-Cola is going to implement it in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is an <unk> innovation, by this technology that today exists.
And we've seen it in mobile phones.
My God, we're going to get to 70 percent penetration penetration in the developing world for the end of 2013.
<unk> that mighty warrior has better mobile communications in the middle of Kenya that President Reagan was 25 years ago.
And by having a smart phone with Google, it has access to more knowledge and information than President Clinton ago.
It lives in a world of information and communication that nobody could have happened.
So better than that, the things that you and I have paid dozens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- <unk> images, images of books and music libraries and music, <unk> technology -- now they are <unk> and they lose market value with mobile phones.
Maybe it gets the best to get the applications in your health.
Last month, I had the pleasure of announce with the <unk> Foundation, something called the X <unk> <unk> <unk>
We're challenging the teams in the world so that you get these technologies into a mobile device with which they talk, and because it has <unk> you can get <unk> you can get blood from your finger.
To win it has to make better diagnoses than a medical medical team.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors, where the burden of <unk> is 25 percent of health workers.
When this device <unk> a RNA virus or the DNA that we don't want to call the <unk> of the health and the first place, to stop the pandemic.
But this is the biggest force of producing a world of abundance.
I call it the <unk>
The white lines here are the population.
We've just been going through the brand of the seven billion.
By the way, the best protection against population explosion is to provide the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, it'll go from two billion to five billion users of the Internet.
Three billion brains have never seen before the global conversation.
What would these people?
What do you do? What <unk>
And instead of an economic collapse we will have the greatest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars in the global economy.
And more health thanks to the <unk> of a better education with Khan Academy with Khan Academy -- and because of using impressions in 3D and computing in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can we give us three billion members of the <unk> healthy educated and <unk>
How about some voices never before <unk>
What if we give the sponsors wherever they are, a voice to be heard and be able to act for the first time?
What do these 3,000 billion?
And if they are contributions that we can't afford them.
One thing I learned with the X Prize is that small equipment, guided by their passion with a target of course, can do things that were going to do things that they could only do the big corporations and governments.
I'm going to finish by sharing a story that really bothers me.
There's a program that probably some of you know.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how you fold the protein.
The crease determine the structure and the functionality.
It's very important in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of <unk>
They've played this with college teachers, among others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people joined and started <unk>
And it has shown that today the machinery of human patterns is better by folding proteins than best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, which gives me a huge confidence in the future is that we have more power to take the great challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of the innovative <unk>
We have the capital capital.
And we have three billion new minds that are being asked to work on the solution of the great challenges and do what we should do.
We have in front of a few decades extraordinary.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
<unk> of the point of <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before I'll give you three examples to make time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
Maybe they believed that <unk> <unk> but it didn't.
<unk> fish.
And he described one of them as very <unk>
It was <unk>
He caught it a lot to the <unk>
Now the fish are in the Red Cross <unk>
But we've heard this story a lot of times, about Galapagos and other places, so that doesn't have anything special.
But the case is that we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
The brochures still say they are still <unk>
So what happens here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept: the shift in the waist.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a West West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could <unk>
I burned a lot with the sun and I was convinced that I was not there.
This is my first exhibition to the sun.
The water was surrounded by <unk> and as you can see, from some <unk>
There were <unk> of about 20 feet -- the black beard <unk>
And the fishery of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good moment, so he became more than a half in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later the fish had dropped in half.
<unk> five inches.
They have a genetic pressure.
There was still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing to changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was complicit in the introduction of North Asia.
In the 1970s. <unk> started in <unk> Europe did a lot of developing projects.
The fishing development was imposing to the countries that already had 100,000 <unk> <unk> the industrial fishery already.
And this boat.
I went to fishing in it, and we did studies in the southern Sea of China <unk> and, especially in the Sargasso Sea.
What we captured there was something <unk>
<unk> I now know, the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we captured was <unk> other animals that are in the background.
And most of the fish are blobs of small blobs on a few <unk> remains that are fish from coral reef.
In short, the sea bottom came to the deck and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very quick.
In a year, you do a study and then you start the commercial fishing set.
The bottom of being a solid coral fund in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a dead <unk>
Not the <unk> The <unk> because they were dead.
Once we captured a alive.
I was still not <unk>
So they wanted to be <unk> because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains is what the fishermen collect every time they go to a place where they have never fish.
But there is no <unk>
We don't remember.
It would be able to start the start to start a new level, without remembering what was there.
If you look at this something like this.
On the axis and we have <unk> biodiversity, we have a lot of <unk> the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Each generation will use the images in the beginning of their conscious life as normal, and it'll extrapolate forward.
The difference is that they perceive loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can look at the standard of changes.
And at the end to keep some <unk> remains.
And that, in a big measure, we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that no longer are, or they're not what they were.
But you should think that this problem is affecting people when they failed societies -- killing animals without knowing what they've done to about generations later.
Because, obviously, an animal that is very prevalent before <unk> is a little bit.
You don't lose animals.
You lose unusual animals.
Even if this is not perceived as a big loss.
Over time, we focus on the big animals, and in a sea synonymous with big fish.
They become unusual because the <unk>
Over time, there are a few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, <unk> that was very different.
And they will do it because the evidence presented in a previous way, is not the way they would expect the evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some <unk> as a captain as a captain of a lot of fish in this area cannot be used or usually they don't use the <unk> scientists because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we lived in <unk> societies because they don't rely on the sources of the past.
So the enormous role that can be able to fulfill a protected marine area.
Because with the marine protected areas, we really <unk> the past.
<unk> the past that people cannot conceive of because the starting point has run and it's extremely low.
That's for the people who can see a marine protected area and they can benefit from the vision that <unk> which lets them erase their point of <unk>
And what about people who can't do that because they don't have access, like the people in the Midwest, for example?
I think the arts and cinema might be able to fill the vacuum.
This is a simulation of the Bay Bay simulation of it.
A long time ago, there were gray whales in the Bay bay 500 years ago.
And you may have noticed that <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think why people were moved with the movie <unk> to talk about the story of <unk> why <unk> with the <unk>
Because it raises something that in a sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only one to give, is to Cameron, do <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hello. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> manager of <unk> and I look at YouTube videos in a professional way.
It's true.
So we're going to see why the videos are making viral and how important that has that.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger, that seemed something very, very difficult.
But today, the web video makes any of us, or from our actions, copper notoriety in a part of our global culture.
Anybody can be famous on the Internet in a <unk>
They get over 48 hours of video to YouTube for a minute.
And of those, only one little percentage is viral is getting infinite <unk> and it makes a cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: The creators of trends, and a surprise.
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh my God, my God.
Oh, my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this video filmed from his house in the National Park National Park.
In 2010, it was seen 23 million times.
This graph shows the <unk> in the rise of the last summer.
<unk> was not saying to do a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double <unk>
That's what you do if it's called Mountain <unk>
There were already published many videos of nature.
This video was published in January.
So what happened here?
He was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this summary that I was sending to the video to be popular.
The creators like Jimmy <unk> are presented with new and interesting things and <unk> them to a wider public.
RS: <unk>  It's Friday, Friday. You want to start on Friday.   Everyone wants me to get the end of a week --  --  <unk> Friday. <unk> your Friday.  KA: Don't think that we could have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
<unk> of Rebecca is one of the most popular videos of the year.
You saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
Just like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to have emerged from nothing.
So what happened this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask for those other <unk> they are also Friday.
But what happened this day, this particular Friday <unk>
Well, I took <unk> and many blogs started to write about it.
Michael J. <unk> of <unk> Science <unk> was one of the first people in making a joke on Twitter.
But what's important is that one person or a group of creators embrace a view of view, and they share it with a broader audience, accelerating the process.
So this community of people who shares this great inner joke then starts to talk about that and do things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody of each other days.
Unlike <unk> entertainment in the 20th century, this community participation is our way to be part of the phenomenon -- or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an absolute animation with a <unk> music.
That's it. That's it.
This year saw it about 50 million times.
And if you think that's weird, you know that there is a version of three hours that has seen four million times.
Even the cats saw this video.
And there are cats that saw other cats see the video.
But what's important here is the creativity that woke up between the <unk> community.
There was <unk>
Somebody made a version of the old one.
And then it became an international one.
Suddenly, we came up with a whole community of <unk> that made this happen from being a dumb joke to something that we can all form part.
Because today not just <unk> <unk>
Who might have predicted something like this?
Who might have predicted <unk> <unk> or Rebecca the Black or <unk> <unk>
What script might have been written by this situation?
In a world where two days of video you go up for a minute, just the only single thing and unexpected it can <unk> the way these things have done.
When a friend told me that I had to see this great video of a kind that protest against <unk> <unk> in New York City, I admit I didn't very interested in it.
Casey <unk> I was forced by no circular for the <unk> but there are often obstacles that prevent you properly <unk>
KA: Thanks to the surprise effect and its humor, Casey <unk> managed to get five million to see and understand his idea.
So this approach is worth the whole new thing that we do in a creative way.
And all of this leads to a great question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
The creators of evidence, creative communities of participation, the totally unexpected, are characteristics of a new kind of media of a new culture, which we all have access to and is the audience that defines be popular.
As I said earlier, one of the current <unk> of the world, <unk> <unk> started on YouTube.
They didn't get permission to express their ideas.
Now we're all a little <unk> of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media characteristics -- it's only the current media, but <unk> the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that is still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the parts.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a whole life.
It's a poet, a <unk> a man whose entire life had been supported in the only single unit and freedom of his country.
<unk> while the <unk> come into <unk> <unk> the fact that their life had been totally in vain.
The words, for so much time friends, they would now be <unk>
They become silent.
He died broken by history.
He's my grandfather.
I never met it.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not to let that be in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story was trying to <unk> but it was <unk>
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat to the dawn of the dawn -- <unk> <unk>
My mother, <unk> was only 18 years when his father died, and a <unk> marriage and two small girls.
For her, life had been destined for a <unk> task to escape her family and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her who couldn't do this.
And after a <unk> <unk> that challenges the fiction, a boat was chimps to sea dressed in <unk>
All adults knew about risks.
The greatest fear were the neighbor, the rape and the death.
Like most adults, my mother was wearing a <unk> with poison.
If we were <unk> we would take my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant rhythm of the motor, the <unk> <unk> in every wave, and the vast horizon and empty horizon in it.
I don't remember pirates that came several times, but they were <unk> with the courage of men in our boat, or the engine dying and not being able to start by six hours.
But I know the lights from the oil board in front of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, to finish the journey was too much to get it, and the first apple that I tasted given for the men of the platform.
None of the apple had after the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp, we had a <unk> <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations, shaping a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a <unk> suburb whose population is comprised of <unk>
Unlike the <unk> suburbs whose existence was <unk> in <unk> there was no sense of the right.
The smells that were from shops were from the rest of the world.
And the <unk> English fragments between the people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then on a <unk> assembly line, working six days a turn.
Yet, I found time to study English and get a headline in IT in the <unk>
We were poor.
And all of the dollars were <unk> and there was an extra <unk> in English.
Two pairs of school for school, one to hide the holes in the other.
A school uniform up to the <unk> because I had to last six years.
And there was weird <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> back home.
At home, where?
Something in me is <unk>
He was accumulating and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I was <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we stood up on our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother at home.
My mother had <unk> all of the ship.
And my job was to be awake until your nightmares started to be able to get a <unk>
She opened a computer store, then I studied to be <unk> and opened another business.
And the women would come with their stories about men who couldn't do their angry transition and <unk> and <unk> children trapped between two worlds.
They looked for subsidies and <unk>
And they were created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, it was the classic classical student with what I would do with myself.
On the other hand, I was <unk> in a daily lives, as well as the abuse of drug abuse and isolation.
But many people received help through years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year of lawyers, I chose the young Australian <unk>
And I was <unk> from a piece of the puzzle to the other, but the edges of not <unk>
So <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was now so <unk> refugee and social activist invited to speak in sites that had never heard of, and in houses whose existence she had never imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat into the <unk> and the comfort of life in a <unk> <unk> -- a mother, a mother and two daughters end the day as they did for almost 20 years, <unk> on the day of each and <unk> <unk> the three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom that I couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I had now the same age that she had when she got up the ship.
He hadn't been an option.
<unk> he said, "What are you not <unk>
So I talked about <unk> youth and education and <unk> to the marginalized and the <unk>
And the more frankly I was talking, more I was to talk about it.
I met people from all the paths of life, many of them doing what they were doing, living on the border of possible.
And although I ended up my <unk> I realized I couldn't stay in a <unk>
I had to have another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be a stranger, a new twist on the scene -- and not just that it's good, but it's something that is being grateful, perhaps a gift of the ship.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave enough steps out of my happy place to know that, yes, the world is <unk> but not the way we fear it.
<unk> that wouldn't have been <unk> they were <unk>
There was a power there, an <unk> optimism a mix of humility and <unk>
So I kept my intuition.
I was going to get a little group of people for whom the slogan cannot <unk> was a <unk> challenge.
For a year, we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of each day, I was making a giant pot of soup that all <unk>
They were going to go to step at night.
Most of our ideas were mad, but some brilliant and we opened up.
I took the decision to move to the U.S.
after a single journey.
My <unk> again.
Three months later, I had <unk> and the adventure <unk>
Before I finish, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time where the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who mattered out.
Life had not changed for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother was raised alone.
At 17 became a <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
No support of her husband, caused an <unk> to the <unk> and to bring the cause she itself, and much more <unk> caused when I won.
You can't get it to be wrong.
I was in the shower in the hotel in a hotel to <unk> when she died, <unk> <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and I saw it stop the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple, in <unk> and we sat around his <unk>
We tell stories and made sure that we were still with it.
At night a monk came and told us that I had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to <unk> his hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why is his hand hot, and the rest of the body so <unk>
"Because you've taken your hand from the <unk> he said.
"You haven't got it.
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Because of those who we were and how life built us, we can now see that the men who had come to our lives would have been <unk>
The loss. He would have been easily.
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the ship.
Who might want that to you?
However, I'm afraid of the privilege of the easy right.
I can give you a <unk> in your lives, <unk> brave in every wave, the constant rhythm of the engine, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could give it to them and see them safe, I would do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of this is here today, in the fourth or <unk> row.
My story starts in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky.
We were having a conversation about how nothing changed from the time of the ancient Indian <unk> "The <unk>
In those days when Indians wanted to travel <unk> to a car and <unk> the sky.
Now we do it with airplanes.
At that time when I <unk> the great prince warrior Indian -- I had <unk> he took a bow and with a <unk> on the ground, he got water.
Now we do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we took was that the machinery had replaced with magic.
And that was very excited about it.
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
And I gave up this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciating a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't get my friends.
It seemed like the technology had to allow the magic to do not <unk>
My grandfather gave me her <unk> silver <unk>
And this piece of technological piece was for my most magical thing.
It became a golden door to a world full of images of <unk> and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the feeling that the mobile phone, the luxury <unk> and the cameras prevent them out.
<unk> our inspiration.
That's why I was fascinated by this technological world to see how to use it to create magic, instead of <unk>
We were studying books since the 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad I saw a storytelling device that can connect to readers from the entire world.
You can know how to take the book.
Where we are.
Put the text with the image, animation and touch.
The storytelling becomes increasingly <unk>
But what do you do that?
I'm about to launch <unk> an interactive app for the iPad.
He says, <unk> your fingers on every light."
And so --  he says, "This box belongs to me, I write my name.
And so I get a character from the book.
In many moments I get a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live through GPS -- that comes lead to me.
My inner girl are excited with all of these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean magicians and <unk> but to that magic of childhood, those ideas that are <unk>
For some reason, fireflies in a jar always turned me out.
So over here, we have to tilt the iPad to release fireflies.
And actually light your way into what subtraction of the book.
Another idea I was fascinated by a little girl was that all of a galaxy are going on in a <unk>
So here, every book and each world becomes a <unk> that I move towards this magical device inside the device.
And this opens a map.
In all fantasy book, there's always been maps but have been static maps.
This is a map that grows, <unk> and guide you over the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book also <unk>
Now I'm going to go in.
Another incredibly important aspect to me is creating Indian content and a contemporary time.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of <unk> and <unk> but how many people were out of India know their counterparts <unk> the <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the cameras of Indra for millennia, in an old <unk> book.
So we're bringing them back into a child history of <unk>
In a story that deals with current issues like the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems over the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> attached to their <unk> they haven't left the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can take our children into the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions in the book is this adventure where you have to go out the outside, take the camera or iPad, and we collect images of different natural objects.
As a girl I had a lot of <unk> rocks and <unk> and <unk>
For some reason kids don't do it.
So to restore this particular ritual of childhood you have to go out and, in an chapter, they <unk> a picture of a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
And so you create a digital collection of photos that you can then put on the Web.
A kid in London puts a picture of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, today I saw a <unk>
A kid in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this social network around a collection of digital pictures that have been taking.
Within the variants of connection between magic, the Earth and technology is many possibilities.
In the next book we asked to have an interaction where you go out with the iPad and video on and can augmented reality -- you see a group of cartoons that appear on the inner plants in the house.
At a moment the screen is full of leaves on it.
And you have to make the sound of the wind and <unk> to be able to read the rest of the book.
We're going to a world where the forces of nature will be <unk> with technology, and the magic and the technology comes to each other.
<unk> the energy of the sun.
We're approaching our children and ourselves to the natural world and that magic, child love that we sit through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why a lot of <unk> projects.
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is that we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at the University of <unk> was <unk> to a CEO of listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she raised a little cup of coffee or tea and asked patients, family, and <unk> What do you do?"
"How can we care?
And we tend to think that this is one of the biggest problems that all of us, or perhaps not all, but most of the projects of <unk> are failing, because we stop listening.
This is my Wi-Fi scale that is very simple.
It has a doorknob on and it has closed up.
Every morning I was shocked.
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I put the challenge to <unk>
But it's so simple, every time I <unk> it sends my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor of <unk> has access to him as well. So he can see what my problem is with weight, not at the same time in which it needs <unk> or any urgency of that style -- but I saw it backwards.
But there's another thing.
Like some of you you know, I have more than 4,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect my Wi-Fi scale and before you get up to my car, people start to <unk> <unk> I think you need a light lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure from the base pairs to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can be <unk> to move people from their chairs and together to develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health.
From next week to be available at the next week.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or a <unk>
And people were going to get out from their homes, taking their blood pressure to their doctor, and share with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, they come back to recover control and to be captains of their own <unk> but it can also help care of health care because of the challenges that we face, as the firing of the costs of attention to the <unk> of demand and other issues.
And techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients on the team.
And you can do it with techniques like these, but also by <unk>
And one of the things that we did like to share it with you with a video.
We all have sailing in the <unk>
We even have them in our cell phones.
We know perfectly where ATM machines are <unk>
Where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find chains of fast food.
But where is the nearest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked it, but no one is <unk>
No one knew where to get the <unk> saves lives at this time.
What we did was do <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public <unk> you see a <unk> for <unk> <unk> where, and when it's open, because sometimes you open up in <unk> and others are closed.
And over 10,000 <unk> they were introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the app for that.
And we did an app for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> <unk> to find these <unk>
And every time you're in the city of <unk> and somebody else -- they can use your iPhone, and at the other time, they can use their cell phone cell phone to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I'd like to introduce this one, not just as <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but as a <unk>
And we want to call them globally.
We are <unk> all of the colleagues in the world, in other universities, so that we will help us find out and act as a center for the <unk> of <unk> across the world.
Every time you're on vacation and someone <unk> can be a relative or someone in front of you, you can find it.
I also want to invite companies around the world that could help us validate these <unk>
They might be <unk> or people from <unk> for example, to see if the <unk> which shows is still in their place.
Please go through this and not just improve the health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photograph.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because of course, they're photographs that you can't take with their cameras.
My interest for photography was woke up with my first digital camera to the 15 years.
I mixed with my previous passion by drawing but it was a little bit different because when I used the camera to be in planning the process was in planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera, the process ends up when the <unk> is <unk>
For me, photography had more to do with being in the right place, at the right time.
It seemed like anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start when you press the <unk>
<unk> like this: a building on a very <unk> road.
But it has a twist on it.
And even though it keeps a level of <unk>
Or photos are like dark and colorful and colorful at the time but with the common target to keep the level of <unk>
And when I say realism I say <unk>
Because of course, it's not something that I can do, but I always want it to seem to be captured in some way like photograph.
<unk> where you will have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to do with capturing an idea that with capturing a moment.
But what is the trick that makes them seem real?
Are you all the details or the <unk>
Put it on the light?
What is it that creates the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is perspective.
But in the end, it's about our way to interpret the world, and how can you perceive on a <unk> surface.
It's not really about whether it's realistic but what we think is realistic.
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality where we take different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly <unk> objects that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in some way can create something that still seems to be <unk> as if it was there.
But at the same time, we know it doesn't exist.
So let's turn to the brain because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that that doesn't really make sense.
And I see the same process by combining the photographs.
It does actually combine different <unk>
And the things that make a photo seem to seem realistic and I think it's those in which we don't even get the things around us in our everyday lives.
But when I combine photographs is very important, because otherwise something is going to be wrong.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules that will follow to achieve realistic outcomes.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of photos must have the same perspective.
Secondly, the photos are <unk> they must have the same kind of light.
And these two images actually meet these <unk> they were taken from the same height and with the same kind of light.
The third point is to make it impossible to distinguish the beginning and end of different images with a perfect breakthrough.
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
This is another example.
You might think that this is the image of a landscape and the bottom is <unk>
But this image is totally comprised of photographs of different places.
In the staff I think it's easier to create a place that find it because you don't need to put in danger the ideas that has on your head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought this idea in winter knew that I had several months to try and find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing trip.
<unk> are a different location.
The <unk> part was captured in a pit of stone.
And yes, I even did a red house at the top of the island so that it looks more <unk>
So to achieve a realistic result I think we need to planning.
You always start with an idea.
Then you have to combine the different pictures.
And here every piece is very well <unk>
If you make a good job when you take the photos the result can be very beautiful, and at a very <unk>
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'm going to start showing a slide on technology, very boring.
Please be able to <unk>
It's a diagram that I took from a portfolio of mine.
I'm not really interested in showing you the details but the general thing.
This is an analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus the power of local <unk>
What's interesting about this is that this one, as a lot of other people that we tend to see, is a kind of a straight line on a <unk> scale.
In other words, every step of here represents an order of magnitude on the scale of performance.
I'm going to talk about technology.
Here's something weird here.
And that's precisely what I'm going to talk about.
Please light the lights up.
They get more intensity because writing about paper.
Why do you solve technological curves at <unk> scales.
The answer is that if you draw them in a normal curve in which, say, these are the years, or some unit of time, and this would be any kind of a technology that I'd like to make to you -- the diagram would look ridiculous.
That would be something like this.
It doesn't say much.
But if you take for example, some other technology, like transport, on a <unk> curve, it would be very dumb, we would see a straight line.
But if something like this, you have a <unk> change.
If the technology of <unk> transport itself as fast as we could last tomorrow we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go into that rhythm.
There are no <unk> in the history of technological development of an <unk> growth that every few years advance of magnitude.
The question I want to pose is -- look at these <unk> curves that we see that they don't pay forever.
It's not possible to sustain this change as fast as it goes.
It was one of two things.
Or it will be converted to a typical curve. I know like this until it comes to something completely different, or maybe I'm going to do something like this.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, I think maybe it might happen.
So now we would be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition from what used to be the world, to a new way.
So what I'm trying to ask, is this new way that the world <unk>
Why new is the world <unk>
The transition seems very, very confused if we're engaged in it.
I remember the future was happening in 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see the future is still the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because we feel something is going on.
We can feel it.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot to think about 30 or 50 years because everything will be so different than extrapolate what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how could that transition to <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and look at the long-term things.
The time scale that I'd like to do is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at each billion years.
And so we go back about two million years when the Earth was a great rock <unk> with a lot of chemicals that were going around it.
If we look at the way that those chemicals were organized by a sense of how things happened.
And I think there are theories to begin to understand the origin of RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this -- and that is that, at that time, there were some <unk> of oil with all kinds of chemical recipes inside.
Some of those oil drops had a particular combination of chemicals that made them put out of the outside of the outside of the outside and the drops of the <unk>
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the most <unk> cell forms -- those oil <unk>
But those drops weren't alive, in the current sense, because each one of them contained a random prescription of chemists.
And every time you get <unk> it would be a <unk> distribution of the chemicals that we have.
So every <unk> was a little bit different.
In fact, drops that in some way to be <unk> being better at the time of bringing chemical chemicals together, <unk> more chemicals and <unk> more.
Most of the time, they were more <unk>
It was a way of life, a very simple chemistry, but things are interesting to be interesting when these drops learned the trick.
In some way that we don't really understand very well these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learn to save information, which was the recipe for the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this evolution, without any sense, a writing system that allowed them to record what they were to be able to be able to get it.
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained steady since it evolved a half billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living will be expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just for <unk> Now we can write things with this code.
Here I have 100 <unk> of white powder that I try to hide the security people.
But <unk> I took this <unk> The code has the common letters that we tend to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data in this piece of DNA and it would take it 10 to 22 times.
So if someone wants to have 100 million copies of my personal card -- I have a lot to all the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world, and it's here.
If it was a <unk> he would have put it in a virus, and it would have spread it through the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells happy another billion years ago.
But then another big step happened in which things are very different, and it was that these cells started to exchange and communicate information forming the cell community.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
That way, for example, evolved resistance.
Some bacteria found the way they avoid penicillin and they were <unk> to create their little DNA with other bacteria and now there's a lot of resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave place to be able to be able to get communities that, in a way, they were together to be together and a <unk>
<unk> or <unk> together, or whatever if a community was very successful all the individuals in that community were going to get more and they were <unk> by evolution.
And the inflection point happened when these communities came very close that, in fact, they came together and decided to write the whole recipe from the community board in a chain of DNA.
The next interesting stage for life took another billion years.
And at that stage, we have communities that are familiar with communities of many different types of cells working together as one organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell is not serves without the heart, or the <unk> or the brain, etc.
So these communities evolved and produced more interesting levels than cell phone, something we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
These started <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that didn't make more than processing information in community.
They are <unk> structures.
The neurons are the devices that process that mobile communities built.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being the responsible structures of <unk> understanding and convey the information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not the time of evolutionary time.
So one organism could, for example, learn how to eat some fruit because they knew wrong and sick the last time he ate it.
That could happen during the life of a organism given that they had previously built these information processing structures that by evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals who ate that fruits of the individuals.
So the fact that the nervous system built those information structures accelerated the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen confined to an individual.
It could happen in the time we need to learn.
But then, of course, individuals figured out the trick trick.
So for example, the most <unk> version we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea a very complicated idea in your head.
I'm sitting here on emitting <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea, <unk> and <unk> in your heads that holds some analogy with mine.
But we take something very complicated that we converted it into sound, in sound, and we produce something very complicated in the other brain.
That lets us start to work as a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've started doing <unk>
We now go through periods similar to organisms -- <unk> <unk> our <unk> methods and information processing and information processing.
For example, the invention of the language was a little step in that direction.
<unk> the computer <unk> the <unk> the <unk> and so forth, are the specialized mechanisms that we now built to handle that information.
And that brings us into something much larger, faster and able to evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen in microseconds.
You saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> where there was some evolution with the <unk> program in our eyes.
And now we've accelerated the scales of time again.
The first stages of the history that I told you about took a billion years every one.
The next few stages the nervous system and the brain, it took about hundreds of millions of years.
And so the language and so on, they took less than a million years.
And the beyond, like electronics, seems to take a few decades.
The process is <unk> I guess <unk> is the right word to name something that accelerates its own pace of change.
The more it changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we observed in this curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I make my life designing computers, and I know that the mechanisms that work for <unk> would not be possible without the recent images.
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me to become a conventional way.
I don't know that every transistor in that machine machine.
There are billions.
Instead, with the designers, <unk> designers, we think about a level of abstraction, we put it on the machine and the machine with that does something that you didn't can, it gets much further away and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes it uses methods that we don't even understand well.
A particularly interesting method that I've been using -- is evolution itself.
We put inside the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of the microseconds.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please computer, you can run a hundred million footage from <unk> <unk>
You could run these random instructions, running all those programs, and take those more <unk> to what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to order numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are more like testing numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences of instructions, <unk> numbers, so none of them did.
But again, he could find two numbers on the right order.
And I said, <unk> could you take 10 percent of those random sequences that did the <unk>
<unk> those and <unk> the rest.
And now they are going to make the best <unk> the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of <unk> analog to <unk>
Let's take two programs -- that <unk> children, which <unk> <unk> and that the children are taking the properties of both programs.
So we got a new generation of programs from the combinations of programs that had a little bit more successful.
And we say, "Please, repeat <unk>
Take it back again.
I would have some mutations in it.
And it tries new and <unk> with another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can make the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or in complicated cases, in a few hours.
In the end, we ended up with programs that orders absolutely perfect numbers.
In fact, they are much more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't say how they work.
I've tried to run them to see how they work.
They're <unk> strangers.
But they meet <unk>
In fact, I know, I have the safety that we get the goal because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that did it.
In fact, their lives depend on this.
Once I was on a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he pulls up a card and he says, "Look at this.
He says, <unk> plane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> who work together to offer a <unk> flight.
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they become complicated.
So we started to depend on computers to make different design processes.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than the normal engineering.
And yet, we don't understand all the options that are.
In that sense, it's in front of us.
We now use these programs to make computers much faster and so we can run these programs much more quickly.
I mean, they are <unk>
The thing goes faster and faster and so I think it looks so <unk>
Because all of these technologies are <unk>
We are <unk>
And we're at an analog moment to the <unk> organisms when they became <unk>
We are the <unk> and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the turning point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant from our part to think that we are the final product of evolution.
And I think that all of us are part of the creation of what it is.
But now it comes lunch and I think I'll stop here before I was <unk>
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that has to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent time enough to let me give up part of my false <unk>
Before I treat my talk about my talk, let's talk a little bit about baseball.
Why not?
We're close to the end, the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
baseball is filled with amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's going to go out of <unk> the <unk> talks about the statistics and to use them to form a great baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope many of you know.
It's called <unk>
And we talked about 300 percent of an <unk> that we <unk>
That means the bat <unk> three of 10 times.
That means throwing the ball into the game of play without being <unk> and that anyone who tries to try to hate the first base -- it didn't get to time, and the second base will be <unk>
Three <unk>
You know what they call a <unk> of 300 in the Great <unk>
Well, actually, maybe the team of the stars.
You know what they call a baseball baseball <unk>
By the way, that's someone from 10 <unk> it hit four.
<unk> like Professor Ted Williams, the last player in the League of League <unk> to run more 400 strikes in a regular season.
Now I want this to my medical world where I feel much more comfortable, or perhaps less uncomfortable, after what I'll tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and they're <unk> to a surgeon who has also a number of 400 in <unk>
It doesn't work, right?
Now suppose that they live in a remote place and a wanted to have two clogged arteries and your family doctor derived to a cardiologist whose record is <unk>
But you know what?
She's getting a really better improvement.
And their hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I'll ask you.
What do you think about to be the average of a heart surgeon or a heart surgeon or a nurse or a <unk> <unk>
1,000, very well.
And the truth of the issue is that nobody in all medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, a doctor or a <unk>
What we do, though, is sending them to the world, and I would lie to the <unk> <unk>
And I'd never, ever make a mistake and try to figure out how to do it right.
That was the take-home message when I was in medical school.
I was a graduate student <unk>
Once, a fellow in high school said that Brian Goldman <unk> to a blood test.
Such which.
<unk> in my little <unk> in the Valley of the General <unk> at the General General <unk> not far from here.
And I learned all of memory.
From my kind of anatomy, <unk> the origin and the <unk> the <unk> of every artery that comes from the <unk> the <unk> and frequent <unk> and <unk>
And I even knew the full diagnostic of how to classify <unk> <unk>
And as we get more and more knowledge and more knowledge.
And I was very fine. I graduated from <unk>
And <unk> of medical school with the impression that if you were to <unk> everything, then it would know everything, or as possible as I was close to everything, because I get rid of the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met the lady <unk>
I was a resident in a college hospital here, in Toronto when they brought the lunch lady to the emergency room where I worked, and I worked.
At that point, I was assigned to the service of <unk>
And when I applied to this cardiologist to go to a cardiologist -- I was going to go to that patient.
and informed the head of residents.
When I saw the lady <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when I was <unk> I heard a <unk> sound on both sides, which <unk> a heart failure.
In these conditions the heart stops working, and instead of pump the blood forward, the blood goes to the lungs, and that's why there's a difficulty breathing.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I got to work on the treatment that I was given.
I gave him <unk> and medication to alleviate the pressure in his heart.
I gave him <unk> of water, so that I could get a liquid.
And in one hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I felt very good.
And that's when I made the first <unk> he sent her home.
I actually made two more mistakes more.
He sent her home with not talking to the head of residents.
I didn't wake up the phone, and I didn't do what I should have done, that I was calling my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss had seen it, it would have been able to deliver <unk> information.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident to get constant care.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to take <unk> that I could take care of my patients without even contact my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
When I send it home, I didn't pay attention to a voice in my inside that he said, <unk> it's not a good idea. Don't do it <unk>
In fact, I was so confident that until he asked the nurse who would take the lady <unk> "Do you believe that it's okay if you go to his <unk>
And the nurse thought, and then he said with total <unk> "Yes, I think I'm going to be right."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So he signed up the high school, and the ambulance along with the ambulance and the ambulance with the ambulance took her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in the stomach,
But I went on with my job.
At the end of the day, I went to leave the hospital and walked into the parking lot where my car was going to go home. At that moment I did something I don't normally do normally,
It happened for the emergency service service house.
And there another nurse, not the one that I was talking about from the lunch lady before, but another one was told by three words, those three words that most doctors in emergency doctors.
Other specialists fear fear too, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and that is that we see the patients <unk>
The three words are remembers you?
He remembers the patient who sent her <unk>
I asked the other nurse with total <unk>
And they said, "Well, she <unk> with the same tone of voice.
She was fine.
But I went back and on the verge of death.
At an hour of an hour of having come to her home, after I gave him the tall, he suffered a collapse, and her family called the <unk> the ambulance <unk> with a blood pressure of 50 millimeters of <unk> which means a severe strangers.
Just breathe and was blue.
The emergency staff <unk> all its resources.
They gave them medication to raise blood pressure.
They put a <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mixture of feelings because after the <unk> was in intensive therapy, and I was hoping against all hope that they were <unk>
And in the two or three days later, it was obvious that they never <unk>
He had permanent brain damage.
The family came together.
And at eight or nine days, they would get rid of what was happening.
And by the ninth day, he left her to go. The lunch lady and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names that they die.
That was my first experience.
The few weeks later, I would tell me about it and experienced by the first time <unk> shame that exists in our medical culture and I felt just, <unk> without feeling that healthy shame because you can't afford your colleagues.
You make peace and you never make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
<unk> shame that I talk about is that makes us feel very wrong with it.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we're bad guys.
And that felt.
And it wasn't for my <unk> he was a <unk>
I spoke to the family and I'm sure that I would get the things and made sure that I didn't get <unk>
And I kept getting those questions.
Why did I not ask my <unk> Why did he sent her home?
And in my worst <unk> why made it a mistake that <unk>
Why do I choose medicine?
Little to that feeling was <unk>
And I started feeling better.
And in one day, he opened the sky and finally came out the sun. And I wondered if I would feel better again.
And I made a deal with myself where if you make the efforts to be perfect for not to make more mistakes, I would make that voices.
And it did.
I went back to work, again.
But it became coming.
Two years later, I was an assistant in the emergency department in a community hospital in the Northern Northern Toronto, and I received a man in 25 years with a pain in the <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I watched his throat, I was a little bit <unk>
They were trying to penicillin and penicillin him at the house.
But as he ran the door to the door he was still pointing out his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to make my guard, my boss, my head asked me to talk to me about his office.
And I took three words: it remembers you?
Remember the patient he saw by a pain in the <unk>
Well, he came back and I didn't have a <unk>
He had a potentially mortal condition called <unk>
You can search for Google. It's an infection, not the throat, but it can cause the end of those tracks.
He didn't die.
They were <unk> antibiotics by going on and recovered in the few days.
And I went through the same time of shame and <unk> then I went back to work, and I went back to work, until it happened and again, and again.
Two times in the same turn of the E.R. not <unk> <unk>
And it's a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because they would get 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home, and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a <unk> <unk>
It turned out an X-ray of kidneys, but it turned out a normal <unk> a colleague who was checking the patient -- a certain sensitivity in the lower right-hand corner, and he called the surgeon to the surgeon.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
I read liquid order for <unk> and I asked my colleague to <unk>
And I checked it and to see some sensitivity in the bottom right-hand corner, called the surgeon to the <unk>
Both were operated and they recovered well.
But every case I was passionate about me, <unk>
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise, and as many colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most meaningful have been over the last five years.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
And here's the problem: If I can't get it, and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what really happens, how can I share this with my <unk>
How do I show you so that they didn't make the same <unk>
If I would go into a place like this one, I would have no idea what you think of me.
When was the last time you heard someone talking about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course at a party you'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you won't hear someone talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues as well, as a <unk> in my hospital -- <unk> the wrong leg -- mind that I would have a hard time to look at it.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
This is the system where there are two <unk> that they make mistakes and the ones that don't sleep and the ones that don't sleep, and the ones that have <unk> and the ones who have great results and those who have great outcomes.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction, like antibodies that start to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you care about medicine to the people who make mistakes, will be a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years about diffusion and journalism and medical journalism -- I've done a personal practice of bad medical litigation and medical mistakes to learn what possible, from the first article I wrote to the Star Toronto to my <unk> <unk> <unk> Black <unk> <unk> <unk> art.
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We worked in a system where mistakes happen every day, where one of every 10 drugs are wrong, or <unk> <unk> or <unk> is not right. In a system where bacterial infections are increasingly more and more <unk> causing chaos and death.
In this country, they die at a country, they die of <unk> medical errors.
The United States Institute of Medicine established 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And so what things are.
A <unk> system where knowledge is added every two or three years, and we didn't get rid of it.
The sleep deprivation.
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow to make a perfect history of a patient with chest pain.
Now, let's take the same patient with a chest pain, it comes <unk> and <unk> and <unk> to alcohol -- and all of a sudden, my story was <unk> by contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things always the same.
And my patients are not cars. They didn't get their symptoms always in the same way.
For all this, the mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system as we <unk> and we eliminate all the professional professionals -- well, you won't get anybody.
And with respect to people don't want to talk about their most <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> <unk> art. It's my worst <unk> I would tell everybody, from the ambulance to the head of surgery -- "This is my worst <unk> blah blah -- "What are your <unk> And <unk> the microphone into them.
And their students were <unk> to go down the head and <unk> saliva and start telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
<unk> can say, "Look, you don't make the same <unk>
They need a context where we can do it.
They need a medical medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The MRI doctor is human, you know, the human <unk> they accept it, and it's not proud of their mistakes, but they were trying to learn from what happened to teach others.
They get their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
<unk> mistakes of other people not with the intention of the <unk> but in a loving way, and for the support for everybody <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that humans run the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes in time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a medical doctor.
I'm a human, we would have errors as well.
And I feel it, but I feel a lot of effort to learn something that can communicate to others.
I don't know what you think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words -- I will remember.
Do you know how many decisions we take a day <unk>
Do you know how we choose a week?
I recently did a survey more than 2,000 people and the average number of choices that he says to pick a half a half a half a half a day.
Not a lot, in a research they followed for a week to a group of companies.
The researchers recorded the different <unk> tasks of these executives and the time that we were trying to make decisions related to those tasks.
They found that, on average, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Naturally, every job included a lot of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required an hour or more of their time.
Now think about your election.
Do you know how many belong to the <unk> category and how many of an hour?
How do you answer the way that manages those decisions?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of <unk> choose to the <unk>
I want to talk about the problem and about possible solutions.
As I talk about this, I'm going to ask you a few questions and I need to know your answers.
When I ask a question, like I'm blind, raise your hand only if you want to burn calories.
In another way, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive please give you a <unk>
And now my first question of the day, they're ready to hear about the <unk> <unk> problem.
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at the University of Stanford, <unk> this <unk> supermarket at least in that time was very sophisticated.
It was called <unk>
It was almost like going to a <unk> park.
It was 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> over 500 different types of fruits and vegetables and about 25 percent of <unk> and this was when we took water from the tap.
I loved going to that store, but I was a occasion, I asked myself, why do I never buy nothing?
This is the shelf of oil oil.
They had more than 75 different classes, including the ones that were in <unk> <unk> that came from trees.
And I decided to visit the manager and I said, <unk> this strategy of offering all these <unk>
He tells me the buses full of tourists that came out every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment with <unk> This is the <unk>
Come on.
They had <unk> different classes.
I had a put on the grocery store.
We put out there in six <unk> or 24 flavors and looked at two things: First of all, where people were willing to stop the <unk>
More people stopped when there was a 60 percent 60 that when there was only six, 40 percent.
We also look at what case they were more likely to buy a <unk>
Here's the opposite effect.
What they stopped when I had been <unk> only three percent got to buy <unk>
Who stood when there was six, we saw that 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they were six.
Well, they decide that we don't buy <unk> we probably would have a good thing to preserve the <unk> but it turns out that the problem of the <unk> of choices is affecting us in a good decisions.
We decided to decide not to decide, even when this is not <unk>
Now the theme of the day, the financial savings.
I'm going to describe a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we looked at the decisions about savings for about a million Americans, in between about 650 plans in this country.
We were interested in seeing if the number of hedge fund plans for retirement savings plans for retirement, the <unk> program led to people to save for the future.
And we found that there was a <unk>
We had <unk> plans that went from two, to 59 different options.
We found that the bigger the number of hedge fund -- there was less participation.
So if you look at the extremes, we see that in the plans that they offer two funding, the rate of participation was 70 or more, not as high as they wanted.
And in the plans I had to offer about 60 funding, the death rate went to the 1960s.
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when you are more choice, even in that case, there's negative consequences.
So for those who decided to participate, the more the number of choice, more people will be used to avoid actions or hedge funds.
As much more choice, they were more willing to invest in market financial accounts.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we are talking about, to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the previous decade we've seen three major negative implications of providing more and more possibilities.
What is more likely to make the decision, the decision, even when this is against <unk>
They are more likely to take the worst decisions in the finance and the health.
They are more likely to pick things at least <unk> even though objectively objectively it better.
The main reason is that we will be able to look at that huge array of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations for comparison, a contrast and choice of that amazing <unk>
Today I want to give you four simple techniques that we've collected in one way or another, in different research, so that you can test in your business.
The first is, <unk>
You've heard before, but it has never been more true than today, which is less than today.
People are always upset when I say, <unk>
Do you care about losing space in the <unk>
But actually, what we're looking at more and more is that if you decide to cut, get rid of strange options -- there will be a spike on sales <unk> the costs will have a better experience in choice.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> at 15, saw about 10 percent increase in sales.
When the Golden Golden corporation eliminated the products for <unk> cats that are less likely to get the <unk> in <unk> by two <unk> higher sales and less costs.
You know that today's risk today, on average, they offer 45,000 products.
In a Walmart store there are about 100,000 products.
But the largest store in the current world is <unk> and it offers only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato sauce in tin.
In the financial savings world, I think one of the best examples that have come on about how to handle the choices is a <unk> <unk>
All of the employees from Harvard are <unk> automatically to a life of life.
The people who really want to choose, are offered them 20 funding, not 300 or more.
You know that people often say, "I don't know how to <unk>
These are all options that are <unk>
The first thing I do is ask the <unk> <unk> the differences that are between those options.
And if your employees can't afford it, they can't do their <unk>
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was chatting with <unk>
He told me that he would be willing to offer people in this audience a holiday with all paid the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to <unk> and then I want you to give you an applause if you're ready to take the offer of <unk>
<unk> <unk> Okay. Anyone who is ready to accept sale.
They are not more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who is ready for that <unk>
I think I really got to hear more hands.
All right.
In fact, you had more information in the first turn, that in the second time, but I can tell you that they thought the second time was more real.
Because the images were going to be more real.
This brings me to the second technique of <unk> <unk> which is <unk>
For people to understand differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of each choice, and that the consequences must be feeling very <unk>
Why is people spending 15 to 30 percent more on average, when you use debit cards or debit cards than when it uses <unk>
Because it doesn't seem real money.
It turns out to make it more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to get more.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> about <unk> <unk> <unk> who worked in <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were being thrown into a <unk> plan.
So that meeting is exactly how we <unk> we made a little <unk>
So what we added was that we would ask the staff to think about the positive things that they were doing in their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was a increase in the <unk> of 20 percent and an increase in the number they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put in their <unk> account.
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories than options.
For example, this is a study that we did in a magazine aisle of magazines.
We saw that in addition to the <unk> of <unk> the magazine exhibition can contain from <unk> different types to <unk>
But you know?
Because <unk> tells me how to <unk>
These are two <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other <unk>
If you think that on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> you have a <unk>
<unk> <unk> Well, there's a few.
If you think that on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> you have a <unk>
Well, something else.
Turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> but you know something?
This framework is completely useless.
The categories must indicate something to the <unk> not when they <unk>
You often see this problem with those huge lists of funding.
I am supposed to be <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can handle a lot more information than we think, if you just get it a little bit.
We need to increase the complexity itself.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's look at a good decision -- the purchase of a car.
This is a German German manufacturer that enables <unk>
You have to take 60 decisions, to put the car.
And these decisions vary in the number of choices that offers each one.
I have the outside color of the car. I have 56 possibilities.
<unk> <unk> box <unk>
What I'm going to do is change the order of the order of the decisions.
So half of the customers are going to go from many choices, 56 colors, just a few <unk>
The other half of customers are going to go from a few choice, four to 56 colors, many options.
And what am I going to <unk>
What are you so involved.
If you get <unk> there is always the defect in every decision, this tells you that they're <unk> or <unk> we are <unk>
We found that the ones that go from many choices to <unk> <unk> the default button and again, and another one.
The <unk>
If you go from a few options in many, they go there.
The same information, the same number of options.
The only thing I did was to alter the order where the information looks like.
If we start with the easy, you learn to <unk>
Even though you pick the box of change doesn't say nothing about the preferences of the interior <unk> in every way we make a choice.
We're excited about a product that we're building that now has more <unk> with the process.
To sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> alternatives -- we can do it <unk> <unk> we can handle more categories at least <unk> <unk> complexity.
All of these techniques that I've introduced them were designed to help manage the <unk> or better for you, to use them in their business, or to people who are going to work.
I think the key to getting the best of a choice is to be careful about the <unk>
And the more careful we are in our choices better to be able to practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the 1960s in the Germany in the East Germany, if you had a typewriter I had to write to the government.
I had to register a piece of text of example with the machine.
And so the government could track the origin of texts.
If they found a written written by the wrong message, they could track the footprint to the origin of the idea.
And in the West, we don't think that someone could do this, how much that would make the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser printer from any big manufacturer and print one page, that will end up having some yellow yellow dots on each page that follow a pattern that makes you get a pattern and your printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody seems to be a lot like this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, the citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems in the network.
If we look at what happens in the online world, we can put the attacks on their <unk>
There are three main groups there.
Are you the <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> in Ukraine.
<unk> mobile phones is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use cyberattacks to make a lot of money, a huge amount of money.
There are actually a lot of online online cases online, <unk> that we had money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, <unk> <unk> etc., etc.
These guys do their <unk> online, but they do it by illegal media by <unk> banking to steal money from our bills when we bought it in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we bought the computer <unk>
The secret secret service of America, two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account of this guy, Sam <unk> and this account had <unk> million dollars when it was frozen.
Mr. <unk> is <unk> you know her <unk>
And I say it's more likely to be more likely to be a victim of a <unk> than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going to be wrong with worse.
In the future, most of existing crimes online.
The second group of <unk> in importance we see today is not driven by money.
There's another thing that moves, they motivate them the protests, they motivate them the opinions, you motivate them.
Groups like Anonymous have <unk> in the last 12 months occupying a role in the online attacks.
Those are the three main <unk> criminals who do it for money, <unk> them like Anonymous who do it for protest and the last group are the national governments that <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of attack against their own citizens.
<unk> is an initiation authority of the Netherlands or, actually, it was.
<unk> the <unk> last fall because of a <unk>
And we had the safety of the site and a <unk>
Last week, I asked a meeting with representative of the Dutch government, asked one of the leaders if they were <unk> <unk> the death of people because of the attack on <unk>
And the answer of it was yes.
So how do people die from a suicide attack.
<unk> is an <unk> authority.
<unk> <unk>
What are the <unk>
Well, you need to have a website with <unk> <unk> services like <unk>
Except they <unk> a foreign <unk>
And that <unk> <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, Egypt in Egypt <unk> the headquarters of the secret secret police headquarters in April 2011 and during the <unk> of the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder there were notes from a company based in Germany that had been sold the Egyptian government to intercept the communications of the citizens of the country.
They had sold this tool for 3,000 euros to the <unk> government.
The company headquarters is right here.
I mean, Western governments provide tools to protect governments to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments also do this to themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago, I found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by the government government officers to look at their own citizens.
If you are suspected of a criminal case, well, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it goes further.
It <unk> the Internet connection.
<unk> even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all the communication, and listen to the discussions online, to get our data.
When we think carefully about things like the obvious answer should be "Well, it seems a bad thing, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why <unk>
I have nothing to do it.
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's in play.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a matter of privacy against security.
It's about freedom against control.
So if we could trust our governments today in 2011, whatever is going to happen today, to be forever.
<unk> blind in any future government, in a administration that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that have to worry about the next 50 years.
This is where I live in Kenya, in the South Central Park of Nairobi.
These are the cows of my dad, and the bottom of the cows, the National Park of Nairobi.
The National Park of Nairobi doesn't have fences in the largest part of the South, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate freely out of the park.
And predators, like the lions, and this is what they do.
<unk> our cattle.
This is one of the people who killed at night, and so soon we wake up in the morning and we found it very bad because it was the only <unk> we had.
My community, the <unk> we think we came from the sky with our animals and all the land to <unk> and so we value it so much.
So I grew up with a lot of lions.
They were dying that they protect our community and cattle, and they are also mad at the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of six lions who killed in Nairobi.
I think this is so few in the National Park of Nairobi.
A kid in my community, from six to nine years old, is responsible for the cattle.
So I had to find a way to fix this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought that lions are afraid of them.
But I realized that actually, this didn't be <unk> because even helping lions to see the pen <unk>
I didn't give me <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
She was trying to trick lions so they believed it was near the <unk>
But lions are very intelligent.   They came the first day and they looked at the <unk> and they went out, but the second day, they came up and said, this thing is not moving, it's always here.  So he jumped and killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day lions didn't come back.
I discovered that lions are afraid of light that moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch to turn the lights off.
And this is a little lamp from a <unk> <unk>
<unk> everything.
As you can see, the solar cell load the battery and the battery -- the electricity to the little <unk> <unk> I call it a transformative.
And the <unk> box makes the lights up.
As you can see, the <unk> give them outside, because that's where the lions.
And that's how they see lions when they come from night.
<unk> lights and <unk> the lions to think that I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago and since then, we never had trouble with lions.
And the houses in the neighborhood heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals that were lions and asked me if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
You can see them, you can see the bottom, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed in seven houses in my community, and they're serving a lot.
And my idea is also used by all Kenya, to freak out other predators as hyenas, <unk> and it's also using the elephant <unk>
Thanks to this invention, I was fortunate enough to get a scholarship to one of the best schools in Kenya, <unk> International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school is now helping raise money and <unk>
It even led to my friends to my community and installed lights in the houses that they don't have, and I teach them how to <unk>
So a year ago, it was just a child in the grasslands, of the savanna the cows of my father, and I used to see planes to fly, and he said that someday would be inside of you.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come in the airplane for the first time to TED.
My great dream is to get to be an engineer of aviation and pilot when I grow up.
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving cows of my dad and the lions, we can be with lions without any conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my language means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting is to listen to a story like you.
So you got a <unk> Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: Are you working in other electrical inventions.
What's the next one in your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to do one about electric electricity, one near <unk>
<unk> I know you invented electric fences -- but I want to make my own.
CA: So I would do it for a time, right? And <unk> <unk> I've tried it before, but I had tried it before, but I got a <unk>  CA: If I got a <unk> Richard <unk> you're a big thing.
We're going to focus on each step that I would have a friend of mine.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a little girl, I thought my country was the best of the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called "No <unk>
And I felt very proud.
In school, we would spend all the time studying the story of Kim <unk> but we never learned a lot from the rest of the world, except that America, South Korea are the enemies.
Even though I was wondering about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend all my life in North Korea, until everything changed suddenly.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public job.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family was not poor and I was never hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister.
And he said, "When I was <unk> the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the last two weeks.
We are <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak that we're ready to die."
I was very visible.
It was the first time I heard that people were suffering in my country.
At a little while, when I was walking in front of the train station, I saw something terrible that I can't erase my memory.
A woman without life was dead, in the street, holding a child <unk> in his arms looking at his mother's face without being able to do anything.
No one <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of them and their families.
A huge famine, <unk> North Korea in the <unk>
In the end, over a million North Koreans died during famine and only a few survived eating grass, insects and <unk>
They also became more and more frequently <unk> energy cuts out, all around it was completely dark at night except by the sea lights in China, barely crossing the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a picture of North Korea in the night compared to the neighboring countries.
This is the <unk> River, which is <unk> between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North Koreans to cross <unk>
But many people die.
Sometimes it saw bodies floating in the river, sometimes.
I can't tell you the details of how we came out of North Korea, but I can only say that during the years of famine I was sent to China to live with relatives <unk>
But I just thought I'd be separated from my family for the short time.
I could never have imagined that I would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea what life would be like refugee <unk>
But soon I learned that it's not just extremely difficult, but it's also dangerous, because the refugees North America were considered <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible fate in North Korea.
A day, my worst nightmare was actually made when I was arrested by the Chinese police and was <unk> at the police station.
Someone had been accused of being <unk> then <unk> my skills in the Chinese language and asked me a lot of questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to be <unk>
If it doesn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and answered the questions.
At the end of the <unk> an officer told each other, "This was a fake <unk> She's not <unk>
And let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans are <unk> <unk> <unk>
But many of them can be arrested by Chinese and <unk>
These women were very lucky.
Even though there were <unk> were eventually released after a harsh international pressure.
These North Koreans were not so lucky.
Every year, countless North Koreans are captured in China and <unk> to North Korea, where they're <unk> incarcerated or executed in public.
Although I was lucky to escape many other North Koreans have not been so lucky.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identity and fight so hard only to survive.
Even after learning a new language and find work, everybody can be <unk> at a second.
That's why, after 10 years of hiding my identity, I decided that I would run to South Korea going to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much larger challenge than I had expected.
The English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and South America.
We're all <unk> but inside, we've come to be very different because of 67 years of <unk>
I even went through a crisis of identity.
I'm <unk> or <unk>
Where am I?
Suddenly, there was no country that I could call a pride with me.
Even though I went to life in South Korea was not easy, I did a plan. I started to study for the job exam to college.
Just when I was starting to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities took some money that sent my family, and as blame, my family was going to be shifted to the force to a location in the <unk>
They had to run away immediately.
So I started planning how to help them escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way for freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China and went to the border with North Korea.
Since my family couldn't speak Chinese -- I had to go back in a way, for more than 3,000 miles through China and then through Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took one week, and we were almost caught up several times.
Once, our bus was stopped and addressed by a Chinese police officer.
He asked the <unk> and he started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, <unk> I stood up and told me that they were <unk> people who was <unk>
I looked at me <unk> but fortunately I did.
We did all the way to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the guards, <unk> <unk>
But even after switching the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated over the border <unk>
After paying <unk> and bribes, my family was liberated in a month.
But in time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital capital.
This was one of the lowest dots in my life.
I did everything to liberate my family, and we were so close, but my family was <unk> in prison to cut away from the embassy of South Korea.
I was going to come from the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to release my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that time, or the voice of a saying, "What's the problem?"
I was so surprised that a stranger would mind to ask.
With my poor English and a dictionary, I told him the situation, and without <unk> the man was the <unk> and he gave me the rest of the money for my family and to get them out of prison.
I went through my heart, and I asked him, "Why did I tell me?
"I'm not <unk> he said.
"I'm helping the village <unk>
I realized that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind of unknown stranger is a new hope for me and for the people who were <unk> when they were <unk>
And I showed me that the kindness of strangers and the support of international community are really the rays of hope that the village is <unk>
Over time, after our long trip, my family and I met in South Korea.
But achieving their freedom is just half the battle.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families and when they went to a new country, they start with a little bit of money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, human language practices, and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people within North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us keep in touch with family family still inside, and we sent information and money that is helping to change North Korea from the inside.
I've been very <unk> I've received a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North America an opportunity to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans all over the world, including on the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in South Pole.
This is <unk> <unk> stores of <unk> fast food, fast food.
So the city planners came together, and they thought, let's change the heart of South the South order to represent something else, so they changed to Los Angeles -- as if this is <unk> what's actually wrong in the city.
This is the South L.A.   <unk> <unk> fast food, fast food.
Just like <unk> millions of other Americans, live in a food desert, Los Angeles heart Center for the food places to take and eat in the car.
The curious thing is that the food places to lead to kill more people than food in the car.
People are dying of heart diseases in the Los Angeles South America.
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times greater than say, <unk> <unk> which is about 15 miles away.
I think this will happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you don't have access to healthy food, and if every time you come out of house you see the effects that the current food system has in your <unk>
I saw <unk> wheels and sold as a cars.
I see <unk> centers like <unk>
And I think this must stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
The food is the problem and it's the solution.
And then I got tired of driving 45 minutes away from back and back to buy an apple that has no pesticides.
What I did, was to plant a food forest in front of my house.
In a strip of land we call a <unk>
It's about 45 feet by 45 feet.
The point is, that belongs to the city.
But you have to run it.
I said, "Well, I can do what comes in <unk> because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
This is how I decided to get it out.
So my group and I, L.A. Green <unk> we get together and we started to plant our food forest -- trees -- you know, nine complete <unk>
What we do, we are a kind of <unk> group made by gardeners of all of the entire city and completely volunteer, and everything we do is free.
And the yard, was beautiful.
Then someone got <unk>
The city has been over top of me and the <unk> gave me a <unk> saying that I had to remove my yard, the <unk> made a <unk>
And I said, "Come on, right?
An order <unk> by planting food in a piece of land than nobody else is there.  So I was like, "Well, <unk>
Because this time wasn't going to happen.
L.A. Times had the story written by Steve <unk> and talked to the <unk> and one of the Green Green members who put a petition in <unk> with 900 <unk> we were a success.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called me to say, <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why not?
L.A. is the city of America with more <unk>
It's about 68 miles of <unk>
That's about 20 Central Central people.
That's space enough to plant <unk> million <unk> plants.
Why on earth does it look like this?
<unk> a plant will give a thousand seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> will give you 75 dollars a result.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, <unk> your own food.
<unk> your own food is how to print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South Pole.
I grew up with my children there.
I was afraid to be part of this <unk> reality, which was <unk> for me for others, and I'm going to manufacture my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I grew up my art.
As an artist artist <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I use the garden, land, as a piece of canvas, and the plants and the trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
They are <unk> to see what the earth can do.
You just can't imagine how amazing it is a <unk> and how does it affect people.
What happened?
I witnessed how my garden became a tool of education, a transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the ground.
We are the ground.
They get rid of seeing how they affect guys.
<unk> is the most <unk> act and provocative thing that they can do, especially in a <unk>
Also, you get <unk>
I remember one occasion, who came up with a mother and her daughter, were like the <unk> of the night and they were in my garden, salt and looked very <unk>
I, well, man, I felt bad that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this like this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame to see people who was so close to me with hungry, and this only <unk> why I do this, people ask me, <unk> not temes that people will steal your <unk>
What I say, "For God, I don't have fear that you go to <unk>
That's in the street.
That's what it's about.
I want the <unk> but at the time, I want you to take your <unk>
There was another time that I put a garden in a homeless shelter in the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, who helped me download the truck.
It was great, I shared their stories about how this had affected them, and how they used to plant their mom and her grandmother, and it was great to see how this changed, so it was just as only for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had a few people who come from, work and <unk> all in a volunteer plan.
If kids grow <unk> the kids will eat <unk>
If they grow tomatoes, they'll eat <unk>  But if none of this is <unk> if you don't teach them how the food affects the mind and the body, they eat blind what you put them in front of you.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing in which you're stuck on, I see color guys that are on this path designed for them, which doesn't bring them nowhere.
With the <unk> I see an opportunity where we can train these guys who were getting rid of their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe the next George Washington <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of the ground, we never will.
Now this is one of my plans, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens, where people can share food on the same block.
I want to take it up and turn them into <unk>
I didn't tell me.
I'm not talking about things for free, because the free is not sustainable.
The curious thing about sustainability, is that you have to <unk>
What I'm talking about is to try and work to people from the street, to meet the <unk> the pride and the honor and the honor of growing their own food, opening markets in farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want you all to become <unk> <unk> <unk> gardeners <unk>
We need to change the script of what's a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
So the <unk> take your <unk> <unk>
That is your weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, well, if you want to meet me, you don't call me in comfortable chairs and having meetings to talk about doing some <unk> to talk about doing some shit.
If you want to see me, come to the garden with your <unk> so we can plant something.
Peace Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>  You probably everybody will agree with me where this is a very good road.
It's made of <unk> and the asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially not in days like today, where it rains a lot.
You can have a lot of water in the asphalt that we have.
And especially if you go on in your bicycle and these cars go -- that's not very nice.
Also, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material and if we build roads, like in the Netherlands, very close to the cities, you'd want a quiet road.
The solution to that is to do roads from asphalt <unk>
The asphalt <unk> a material that we use now in most roads in the Netherlands, has pores and the water can go through it, because all of the water flow flow over the sides and you will have a road that is easy to drive, and we don't waste water anymore.
The noise will also disappear in these <unk>
Because it's very open, all the noise disappear, so it's a very silent road.
It also has <unk> of course, and the downside of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> Look at this road the stones on the surface of the surface.
First one stone, then several more and more and more and more and more, and <unk> -- well, I'm not going to do that.  But you can damage your <unk> and you will not be happy with that.
And finally, this can also lead to more and more damage.
Sometimes they can create <unk> with that.
<unk> It's ready.
You can turn it into a problem, but we have a solution.
So here you can actually see the damage to the material.
It's a <unk> asphalt as I said, so it only has a little amount of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> to the light, this <unk> this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> and if they were <unk> they're going to be <unk> and they will separate from the <unk>
So if you drive on the road, you will get the <unk> as we saw here.
To solve this problem, we think about <unk> materials.
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use wool from steel from that to clean up, and we can cut the wool of steel in very small pieces, and we can mix these little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little pieces of skin wool on it.
And then you need a machine, like the one you see here, that you use for <unk> a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat, especially steel is very good at that.
So what you need to do is to be able to heat steel, melt the <unk> the <unk> flow through these <unk> and the stones will go back to the surface.
Today I used a <unk> <unk> because I can't bring the big <unk> machine here onstage.
The microwave oven, is a similar system.
I put the sample, I'm going to take you to see what happened.
This is the sample right now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples.
So we tried a lot of samples out there and then the government, they actually saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's very interesting. We've got to <unk>
So we donated a piece of road, 400 meters of the <unk> <unk> where we had to do a lane of trial to test this material.
So that's what we did there. You see where we were doing the test on the road, and then, of course, this road will last several years without any harm. That's what we know about practice.
We took a lot of samples from this road and we tested them in the lab.
We did age samples, we put a lot of payload into them, and then we put it up with our <unk> machine and the knowledge and we went back to it.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can tell you that we've done a material using steel, incorporating these fibers, using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the life of the surface of the road, even you can double the lives of the surface. They can actually save a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, they are curious if this worked.
We still have the show here. It's quite hot.
It actually has to cool first before I can show you how it acts on it.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember having woken up one morning with the sound of <unk> in my house.
My father was listening BBC on his little gray radio.
I had a great smile in his face that was unusual at those time, because the news is usually <unk>
"The Taliban <unk> her father.
I didn't know what to <unk> but I could see that my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a school of <unk> he said.
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban would fall out of Afghanistan and made the girls to go to school.
For the next five years, I was reminded as a child to get my older sister -- who I couldn't be used to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that the two could be <unk>
Every day, we were taking a different route so that no one could be suspicious where to <unk>
We had to hide the books in <unk> to look like it looks like they were shopping.
The school was at a house, more than 100 of us <unk> in a small room.
It was pleasant in the winter, but extremely <unk> in the summer.
All of us knew that we had our lives -- the teacher, the students and our parents.
Occasionally the school suddenly was suddenly a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they did.
They were <unk>
Did you know where to <unk>
We were <unk> but still the school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters a <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> in a remote province of Afghanistan. <unk> that his daughter, my mother, went to school, and his father was <unk>
But my mother educated became a teacher.
This is it.
It took two years ago, just to convert our house in school for girls and women from our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of his family in getting education.
There was no doubt that their children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the risks.
For him, there was a greater risk not to educate their children.
Over the years of <unk> I remember there were moments when I was very frustrated about our life and was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up but my father said, <unk> my daughter -- you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money. You can try to leave your house for a war.
But there is one thing that always will be with you, what's here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we will.
So, you don't want to <unk>
I have 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of the women of my age has more than high school, and if my family had not been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself proud to graduate in <unk> College.
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was <unk> from her home for courage to educate her daughters, was one of the first to <unk>
He didn't only get rid of my college degree, but also that I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman, which I've been driving on the streets of Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I dream big, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I am the global <unk> of <unk> a global campaign to educate the women.
This is why <unk> <unk> the first one and perhaps the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country that is still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is I see students in my school with the strong desire to leverage the opportunity.
And I see her parents and their families who, like the mine, <unk> for them, even though they were still in front of a <unk> opposition.
As <unk> It's not his real name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month, he and his daughter went on the way from <unk> to her village, and they literally escaped from being killed by a bomb on the way, for minutes.
When you get to your house, they are the phone, a voice would pick up that if he kept sending her daughter to school, they would come back to try.
<unk> already, if you <unk> he said, "but I don't hurt the future of my daughter for your old and <unk> ideas."
What I've realized, in Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind the majority of the people who are <unk> there is a father who recognized the value of his daughter and he sees that the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key to our success.
In fact, they're often the first compelling <unk> of the bright future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like the Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under <unk> girls who were to school they were to school in <unk> remember, it was illegal.
But more than three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan is so different from here in the U.S.
I find that the Americans see the fragility of changes.
They were <unk> that these changes didn't last a lot, after retirement U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I look at the students in my school and their parents who were <unk> for them, that <unk> I see a future <unk> and <unk>
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities -- and every day the girls of <unk> would give me.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
never, I've never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> <unk> against him.
But you never get a revolutionary <unk> <unk>
They have spent almost two years since the Tunisian revolution was inspired by the <unk> of mass <unk> so much of the <unk> revolution like the <unk>
A forces with many other citizens <unk> inside and outside of the country to call a day of anger and start a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And it was a great revolution.
Women and young men who were <unk> were in the <unk> <unk> the each regime carrying <unk> of freedom, dignity and social justice.
They've shown a <unk> of the <unk> the brutal dictatorship of <unk>
They've shown a great sense of solidarity from the Middle East, to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of brutal war and a loss of about 50 thousand dead, we managed to release our country and overthrowing the <unk>
However, <unk> left a <unk> a legacy of <unk> corruption and seeds of <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure, the culture and the moral structure of society <unk>
<unk> out of the devastation and the challenges, I've loved with a lot of other women, to rebuild civil society <unk> a transition and fair transition to democracy and national collaboration.
There were about 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the <unk> about 300 in <unk>
After a period of a period of 33 years of exile, I went back to Libya and with a unique enthusiasm -- I started organizing workshops about developing capabilities, and leadership skills.
With an amazing group of women, we founded the <unk> of Women -- <unk> by <unk> a movement of women, creative orientation -- to advocate for the Tunisian autonomy autonomy of the woman and for our right of participation in the building of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the period of <unk> an environment that was increasingly <unk> than <unk> of the selfish policies of domination and <unk>
Over time, our initiative was sent and successful.
Women won a <unk> of Congress in the first election for 52 years.
However, little bit, the exhilaration of elections and the revolution as a whole, they were <unk> every day we were moving from violence.
One day I woke up with the news of <unk> of ancient mosques and <unk> <unk>
Another day with the news of the murder of the American <unk> and the attack on the <unk>
And another day we woke up with the news of the army of military officers,
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of the <unk> and their so-called <unk> of human rights of prisoners and their lack of respect for law.
Our society, made by a revolutionary mindset, it becomes more <unk> and it's been away from the ideals and the principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, we had at the beginning.
<unk> <unk> and revenge became the icons of the consequences of the revolution.
I'm not here today at all today to do with our history of success of the <unk> <unk> and the election.
I'm here today to tell you that we, as a nation, choosing evil, we take the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize well.
Because the choices didn't brought peace and stability and security to Libya.
The list <unk> and the <unk> between <unk> and <unk> brought peace and <unk>
No, they didn't do it.
What happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated by selfish policies of domination, and <unk> both for men like women?
Perhaps what was missing was not only women, but female values of compassion, mercy and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and the creation of consensus more than I needed the election -- which only is the polarization and the <unk>
Our nation needs the dominant representation of the female of the female representation and quantitative <unk>
We need to stop acting as agents of outrage and calling days of anger.
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.
We need to develop a female speech, not only <unk> but also putting it in practice the mercy of mercy instead of <unk> in the place of competition, the inclusion instead of <unk>
These are the ideals that one Libya, <unk> by war, desperately needs to be the end of reaching peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about the interrelationship and the <unk> between women's <unk> and <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in a existential way before it was <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> "is the word of God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the time, the word <unk> which is known as all the traditions -- it has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> the female and <unk> which applies to all of the humanity that men and women and women, that all tribes and all the peoples have <unk>
And so, just like the uterus covers the <unk> that grows inside, the divine matrix of compassion <unk> all of existence.
So it tells us "My mercy <unk> all the things."
This is how you say, "My <unk> <unk> on my <unk>
And they were all going to tell you the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a spooky question that has a equally unknown answer.
It's about the secrets of the domestic violence, and the question I'm going to tackle is the one that everybody is doing -- why she is left?
Why was someone going to stay with a man who was <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, nor social worker, no expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was 22 years old. I was at the University of Harvard.
I had moved to New York City for my first job as a writer and editor in <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first green <unk> American <unk> and had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, that I creates my soul <unk> I was holding my head with a <unk> with <unk> <unk>
The man, when I loved anyone in this world, put a gun in my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a gay <unk> trap.
It might be your story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm a <unk> in English at Harvard University, and I have a MBA in <unk> Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for the <unk> list of <unk> <unk> between them Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington <unk>
I've been about 20 years married with my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and I lead a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all races, all of the religions, all the levels of income and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Exactly.
More than 85 percent of <unk> are men, and domestic abuse only happens in <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> or, in another way, in the families, the last place where we would want or we expect to find <unk> for which, domestic abuse, turns out so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world that was going to sit with a man who was <unk> and actually I was a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States women are about 16 and 24 years old, they have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other ages, and more than 500 women and girls from that age killed every year by couples, <unk> and husbands -- in the United States.
I also was a typical victim, because I knew nothing about domestic violence, their warning signals or their patterns.
I met <unk> in a cold and <unk> evening.
I was sitting next to me in New York subway in New York City and he started <unk> with me.
He said two things.
The first one was that he also had had a <unk> university school, and he was working on a very important bank on Wall Street.
But what struck me about in that first encounter was that it was ready and fun, and it seemed like a <unk>
He had some big <unk> like apples, and a <unk> wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the most intelligent things that made <unk> from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of partner.
He did it especially at the beginning, <unk> in a <unk>
We started going out and loved all of me, who was ready, that he had gone to Harvard, that I put a passion in helping teenagers, and my work.
I wanted to know everything about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, like nobody had ever done it.
And it was why the degree of that <unk> school and the work on Wall Street and his brilliant future had so much relevance to him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> the victim.
And I didn't know that the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing that I wanted to do was I'm going to go from New York to leave my dreams, but I thought I'd be able to do any sacrifices for your partner, so I was trying to quit my work and <unk> and I went together with Manhattan.
I had no idea that I was falling into a <unk> <unk> who was coming from head to a physical trap. and financial and psychological trap.
The next step in the heart of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it reacts to.
And here is where those <unk>
As much as we moved to New England you know, that site where you're supposed to be so safe to buy three <unk>
One was in the <unk> of the car.
Another shot underneath the pillow in our bed and the third always in his pocket.
And he said that I needed those guns to cause the trauma that lived in a small way.
He needed them to feel secure.
But those guns were actually a message for me, and although I'd never lifted my hand, my life was already serious danger, every minute of every day.
The first physical attack of <unk> happened five days before our wedding.
It was the seven in the morning and I still had <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises of my neck had disappeared, I put the girlfriend of my mother and married me with him.
Despite what had occurred, I was sure that we lived happily to always, because I loved him, and he also wanted me a lot.
And I was very, very <unk>
It just had felt very <unk> for the wedding and because of a family with me.
It had been an isolated accident, and it never would be hurt.
I spent two times more in our honey.
I was the first time I was driving into a secret beach and I was <unk> and he gave me so strong in the head that I was <unk> several times against the <unk> of the car.
And then, a couple of days later, driving back from the moon of honey, he was blown down by traffic and threw a Big Mac cold to the face.
<unk> kept <unk> one or two times a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was amazed when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One of three American women is a victim of domestic violence or harassing at some time in their life, and the Center for Disease Control reports that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So, actually, it was very good company.
So I'll go back to my question: Why would I tell me.
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
Instead, I was a very strong woman in love -- in love with a profoundly <unk> man -- and it was the only person in the world that could help <unk> to deal with the <unk>
The other question everyone does is, why don't you just not <unk>
Why did I not get married, I could have been at any time.
For me, this is the saddest and painful question that people do, because we are victims, because we know something that normally you <unk> is incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is <unk>
More than 70 percent of domestic violence occur after the victim has been <unk> to the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other implications include permanent <unk> even after the <unk> has returned to marry, <unk> of financial resources, and the family court system for <unk> to the victim and their children, who normally are forced by judges to spend time not <unk> with the man who would lie to their mother.
And we still want to ask why it's simply not going?
I was able to go, because of one last <unk> <unk> that beat my denial.
I realized that the man who loved the man I loved it would have killed me if it was allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told everybody about the world: to the police, to my friends and my friends and family, to complete strangers, and I'm here today because all of you will tell me.
We have the tendency to engage the victims of the victims of the Chinese <unk> women, <unk> goods.
The question, "Why is it <unk>
For some people this is a way to say <unk> it is by <unk> as if the victims of the <unk> were intentionally <unk> of men who want to <unk>
But since I published <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who also argued that they learned a <unk> lesson of what happened to them and that they would take their lives joyful and happy as <unk> wives and mothers, lives completely free of violence, like mine.
Because it turns out I'm actually a victim and a survivor of domestic violence.
I was marrying a man <unk> and <unk> and we have those three children.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm not going to go back to ever is a <unk> gun pointing to my head in the hands of someone who says I will.
At this point, they're thinking, <unk> that is <unk> or <unk> which stupid <unk> but all this time I have been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people who are listening to me right now, that they're being <unk> or that they were <unk> they are <unk> themselves.
<unk> could be affecting her daughter, his sister, to his best friend right now.
I was able to end my crazy love love breaking the silence.
And I keep doing this today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request for you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
<unk> abuse only in silence.
They have the power to end with domestic violence just throwing light on it.
The victims we need all over the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
<unk> the <unk> to light talking about it with their kids, their friends and family.
It takes their vision of the survivors as fantastic and <unk> people who have a <unk> future.
<unk> the early signs of violence to intervene consciously, to slow down their climb and show the victims a safe <unk>
Together, we can turn our beds, our tables and our families in the oasis and <unk> that they should be.
Thank you.
Hello. I call myself Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm a model.
To be <unk> for 10 years.
And I feel that at this point, there is a awkward tension in the room because I shouldn't have dressed like that.  Luckily, I've brought them clothes for <unk>
This is the first shift in clothing on a <unk> scenario, so you have a lot of <unk> I think.
If some of the women are <unk> when they <unk> they don't have to be <unk> now, but I'll find out later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think about me in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These are very <unk> less bad than I don't have to use.
The worst part is to go through the head, because it's when you're going to laugh at me, so you don't do anything as I cover my head.
All right.
Why do I do this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but it's also <unk>
I've changed totally what they thought about me in six seconds.
And in this photo, he had never had a boyfriend, in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable, and I was a photographer to tell me that I was going to get my back and <unk> the hair of the boy.
Of course, except with surgery or an artificial tan that I did two days ago for work, there's very little that we can do to transform our respect, which, although shallow and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, to me, being brave means to be honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model, I'm here.
Because I'm a beautiful woman and white, and in my workforce, that's being a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but <unk>
The first question is, how is it to be model?
And I always say, <unk> <unk> I was discovered, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made a model is because I won the genetic lottery and I'm the <unk> of an <unk> and maybe you're wondering what this <unk> is.
Well, in the last centuries we have not only defined the beauty as health, youth and symmetry, which we are biologically programmed to <unk> we have also associated with a high and <unk> shape and a white skin.
And that's my heritage <unk> which I've known to leverage to make money.
And I know that there are people in the audience who are now showing <unk> and perhaps there's some <unk> from the fashion that we <unk> Hold on, and there are <unk> Joan <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, the <unk> to know how much models.
But unfortunately I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student from the University of New York told all and each of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models -- just -- I mean, less than four percent, they were not white.
The next question that people always ask me is: Can it be model when it's <unk>
And my first answer is, I don't know, I don't know that.
But then, what I would say to each of these girls is: Why? You can be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a <unk> surgeon -- which would be awesome, because you'd be the first.
If after this spectacular list, it's still <unk> No, no, Cameron, I want to be a model, then I said, "I know my <unk>
Because I am not in charge of anything, and you could be the head of <unk> <unk> or the CEO of <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
To say that most of you want to be a model is to say you want to win the lottery when you're larger.
It's outside of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a job you can choose.
I'm going to show you all that I learned in 10 years as a model, because unlike <unk> surgery, can be summarized right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you pull your studies, and you have a couple jobs on your back, whether you think that if you want to be president of the United States -- but your resume would want to be president of the United States, but you have a <unk> Model <unk> for 10 years, people would look at you.
The next question that people always do is if all the photos are <unk>
And yeah, virtually all the pictures, but that's just a little bit of what happens.
So this was the first picture I was telling me, and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my time.
I know we're entering the personal field, but it was a little girl.
This is how I looked at my grandmother a few months before.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here's a <unk> party a few days before the photos for the French <unk>
Here's my football team and in the Wired magazine.
And this is me today.
And I hope you'll realize that I'm not me in those pictures.
They are creations of a group of professionals, <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all of their <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and they get to create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always ask me is to do for free?
I have too many inches from 20 inches and ever use, except the couple of <unk> but the privilege that I get is the ones I get in the real life, and we don't like to speak.
I grew up in Cambridge, and I went to a store and I forgot to take money, and I forgot for free.
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> he jumped a red light and of course, and of course, we were <unk> and <unk> a sorry, agent to be able to keep <unk>
<unk> of these privilege by my looks, I don't know why I am. And there are people who are paying a price for how it looks no matter who they are.
I live in New York City, and the past year, from <unk> teenage <unk> were <unk> and <unk> and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> young black and Latino young men in New York, so for them, it's not a question of me:
But how many times do I get <unk> And <unk>
By looking at this talk, I learned that the 53 percent of the <unk> girls in the United States don't like their body, and that figure goes to 78 percent to the 17.
So, the last question that people ask me is: How is the life of a model?
And I think the answer that you hope is, if you're a little bit thinner and you have the most bright hair and you have the most bright hair, and I feel very happy.
And behind the cameras, we give a answer that maybe we will.
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also incredible to be able to work with creative people, ingenious and <unk>
And that's all right, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about my aspect every day.
And if you ever ask, with some stronger legs and the brightest hair will be happier?
They only have to meet with a group of models, because they have the most <unk> legs -- the brightest hair, but it's probably probably the <unk> women of the planet.
But especially it was hard to analyze a situation of racial and gender and gender when I'm one of the biggest <unk>
If there is something that held out of this talk, I hope that everybody feels more comfortable when you recognize the power of the image in the perception that we have about success and failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion since I was more enough to support a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 <unk> photos, and I was not me who <unk>
There was no <unk> or no opportunity to repeat the pictures, not even a little bit of <unk> in lighting.
In fact, most of them were pulled out by random.
My story begins when, <unk> in New York City to give a <unk> my wife took me this picture holding my daughter in the day of his first birthday. That's the corner of <unk> and five.
He gave the chance we went back to New York City just a year later, so we decided to get the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes right now.
When the third birthday of my daughter, my wife told me, why don't you take you to New York on a <unk> journey, and you drive the <unk>
This is when we started to ask the tourists that were going to get us out of the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of delivering the camera to a complete stranger is so universal.
No one has never been denied and, fortunately, nobody has <unk> with the camera.
So we weren't aware of how much life would change this journey.
It became sacred for us.
This picture is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what he had happened that day as a five-year-old could understand.
These pictures are much more than representations of a particular moment or a specific journey.
They're also a way to stop the time in a week in October and make ourselves reflect on our age and our evolution over the years, and not just the physical level, but in every way.
Because even though we take the same picture, our perspective changes -- my daughter reaches new <unk> and I can see life through his eyes and how you perceive and interact with everything.
That time in concrete that we spend together is something that we hope with illusion all year.
Recently, in one of the travel, we were walking, when suddenly he stood up in dry and pointed out a red <unk> of the pirate shop that <unk> in a small number of <unk>
And it described to me what I'd felt like five years of foot in that same place.
<unk> that remembered their heart of heart to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what looks in New York is universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we created is memories.
So I want to share the idea of being active in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but apart from these 15 photos, I don't go out in a lot of family pictures.
I am always the one that pulls the picture.
Today I want to encourage you to all show up in the picture, and I didn't want to get to someone and asked, does it get a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are found in the most <unk> birds.
First, why do they have so bad <unk>
It has also been associated with Disney laughter, as a stupid <unk> characters.
More recently, if you've been following the press <unk> laughter and applause and <unk> these are the attributes that associate with <unk> Parliament -- but I don't accept.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament don't keep clean the environment.  <unk> are not helping prevent the spread of disease.
<unk> are <unk>   You're far from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.   There are two types of <unk> on this planet.
There are the <unk> in the New World that are mostly in the <unk> as the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> where we have 16 species from these 16, 11 are faced with a high risk of extinction.
So why are we <unk> are important, first of all, provide vital ecological services.
It's our natural garbage <unk>
<unk> the cadavers up to the bone.
They help killing all bacteria. They help to absorb the anthrax that it will not be for them to be valued and causing big livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> the carcasses take from three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications in the spread of disease.
<unk> also have a huge historical importance.
They've been associated with the ancient culture of <unk>
<unk> was the symbol of lip and maternity and, along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between <unk> and <unk>
In the mythology of <unk> <unk> was the god <unk> and risked his life to save the Tasmanian devil <unk>
In <unk> culture, they are very important <unk> to open sky in places like Tibet -- there's no place to bury the dead or wood to <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural disposal system.
What is the problem with the <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, of which six are at extreme <unk>
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason they're being <unk> is because there's conflict between humans and <unk> <unk> communities use this venom against predators, and as a result, <unk> are victims of this.
In southern Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are at the critical <unk> list, which means that in less than 10 or 15 years old, and the reason is because they fall prey from the livestock of livestock that has been treated with a <unk> drug like <unk>
This drug has been banned to use veterinarian in India and have taken a statement.
Because there is no <unk> there has been a spread in the number of dogs in <unk> <unk> and when you have dogs <unk> you have a huge pump of time to <unk> the number of cases of rage has increased greatly in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the largest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be up to the Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind, but we have to work with governments, because wind turbines do this to the birds.
They're <unk> of birds.
In West Africa, there's a horrible trade of <unk> in order to serve <unk> and the <unk> market.
So what are you doing? Well, we're looking at these birds. We are <unk> <unk>
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel through different countries, so I focus on a collaborative problem is not going to serve anything.
We need to work with governments in the <unk>
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that we have.
How can you help? It can become assets, make noise. You can write a letter to your government and tell you we need to focus on these very <unk> creatures.
When you leave this room, you would tell them about the <unk> but talk to their families, with their children, with their neighbors on the <unk>
They are very <unk> Charles Darwin said he changed the opinion because he saw them fly without effort, without energy spending in the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much more poor without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do and everything I do <unk> my life has been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> young <unk> but I'm not.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, East <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for an NGO <unk> and every project that we set up in Africa.
And I was <unk>
<unk> the 21, that Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of that, all of us will be <unk>
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> from the <unk> was a project where about Italians decided to teach people of Zambia to grow food.
So we got with seeds <unk> south of Zambia to this absolutely magnificent valley that descends into the <unk> River, and we teach local local tomatoes and Italians and <unk> and ...
Of course, people were not at all all of those interested in doing that, so they would tell them to come to work, and sometimes they were afraid of the local --  -- we were aware that the local men in such fertile valley, had had agriculture.
However, instead of asking you how it was possible that we didn't make anything, we just said, "Thank God we are here --  <unk> time to save the people in Zambia from <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa was grown <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> In Italy, a tomato would grow this size. In Zambia, this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were telling them, we were telling the <unk> "Look at the <unk>
When tomatoes were cute <unk> and red and red at night in the morning, about 200 <unk> came from the river and ate it.  And we said to the <unk> "Oh my God, the <unk>
And the ones -- they said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here."  "Why don't you <unk> You never get <unk>
I thought we only did the Italians who were born mistakes in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans, what they did, what they did, what they did, and then see what they were doing, I felt quite proud of our project in Zambia.
Because you can see, at least we feed the <unk>
You can see the <unk>   <unk> will see the waste that they gave them to the <unk> people in Africa.
He wants to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western donors. We have given the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
Don't tell you about the damage that that money has <unk>
They just read your book.
<unk> from a African woman -- the damage we've done.
The Western <unk> are <unk> missionaries <unk> and we treat people only two things: or <unk> or <unk>
The two words come from the Latin root of <unk> which means <unk>
Yet, they mean two different things.
<unk> I'm trying to deal with any different culture like my children, I want my children, I want a lot."
<unk> I'm trying to deal with all of a different culture like my <unk>
That's why white in Africa are called <unk> boss.
That book gave me a slap in the face of the face -- "The little thing is <unk> written by <unk> who said about all economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> <unk>
This should be the first principle of help.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, Mr. gentleman opened this conference put a cane on the floor, and he said, we can -- you can -- you can imagine a city that is not <unk>
I decided to just respond to people, and invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start anything, you never motivates anyone, but it becomes a <unk> of the local passion, the <unk> of the local people who have the dream to become a better person.
So what do you? Do you <unk>
It never comes to a community with an idea, and you sit with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from offices.
We sat down in a coffee. We get together in a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give an idea to somebody.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what's going to do you?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that man has for his own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then we helped them find knowledge because no one in the world can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have knowledge, but knowledge available.
So years ago, I had this idea: Why not we, for once instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why not, for one time, they were told, but not in meetings within them.
I'll tell you a secret.
There's a problem with the meetings within them.
<unk> never <unk> and they will never tell you in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what a chance have <unk>
So, planning has this blind point.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know it, because they don't present their public meetings.
What do we do? We work one to one, and we work face to face, you have to create a social infrastructure -- which doesn't exist.
You must create a new career.
The profession is the family doctor of the company, the family doctor of the business, who runs in your house on the kitchen table, on the coffee, and that helps him find the resources to transform his passion in a way of making a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city of West Australia.
I was doing a Ph.D. in that time, trying to get away from this condescending garbage where we got to tell you what to do.
In one year, I had 27 projects, and the government came to me to ask, "How can you do that?
And I said, "I did something very, very hard.
And so I was <unk>    So the government says, <unk> <unk>    So we've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We've helped to start 40,000 businesses.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the most successful business mistakes of the story, passed away to '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and a <unk> economy.
The planning is the kiss of death of the <unk>
So now <unk> reconstructing <unk> without knowing what the most <unk> people in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to come to talk with you.
You have to offer you to do it, you have to be fantastic to the <unk> and then they would come to come in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we got 200 customers.
You can imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What are you going to do with you more like this tomorrow?
<unk> local people. That's what you have <unk>
So what I tell you is that the creative spirit is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution <unk> fossil fossils and one point to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way of holding <unk> is not sustainable.
What we need to consider, is how to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution, <unk> <unk>
The government?
They'll be the entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's an amazing story that was in a futuristic journal many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to discuss the future of New York City in <unk>
And in the year they gathered together this group of people -- and <unk> about what would happen to New York City in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City was not there within 100 years.
Why? Because they analyzed the curve and <unk> if the population is still growing up to this <unk> to move to the population of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the dung produced by six million horses would be impossible to <unk>
They were already being thrown out in mice.  So in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that <unk> the life of New York City.
So what happens? In the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States appeared -- <unk> generic companies <unk>
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very little, <unk> factories in <unk> places.
<unk> Michigan. Henry Ford.
However, there is a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer you to <unk>
Otherwise, they wouldn't come to talk to you.
Then, you have to give you an absolute <unk> <unk>
And then then you will have to tell you the truth about <unk>
The youngest company, the largest company, it has to be able to do three things -- the product that you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to tell with a fantastic marketing -- and you have to tell with a great financial administration.
You know what?
We've never met a single human being in the world that I can do, selling and look for the money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is still not born.
We've looked at and looked at the 100 companies in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all the new companies Google, <unk>
There is only one thing that all of the successful companies in the world have in common, only one -- no one was started by one person.
Never love it, but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when it began.
Nobody begins a company alone. Nobody.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business of small businesses in bars with their dedicated Protestant who will do for you, what someone did for this gentleman who is talking about this <unk> somebody who speaks to you, someone who will ask you, what need to do?
What can you? Can you do it?
Well, you can <unk> you can look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that." <unk> I want you to <unk>
We activate communities.
Thank you.
People around us can help us in a lot of ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't switch a lot of knowledge despite sharing the same public spaces.
Over the last few years I've tried to share more with my neighbors in the public space, with simple tools like <unk> templates and chalk.
These projects came from questions like, how much pay my neighbors for their <unk>
How can we pay and ask more things without calling the door at a bad moment?
How do we share more memories of our abandoned buildings and better understand our <unk>
How do we share more of our hopes for empty stores so that our communities can reflect on today our needs and <unk>
I live in New York City, and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the giant <unk> that they give shadow to <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust a city.
It always happens to sink into music.  The city has one of the most beautiful architecture of the world, but also one with the largest number of abandoned properties.
I live close to this house and I thought how it could turn it into a very nice space for the neighborhood and also something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was <unk> as a mother for <unk>
He was sudden and unexpected it was unexpected.
I thought a lot about death and <unk>
And this made me a deep gratitude for the time and the living time.
It gave the clarity of the significant things in my life today.
But I want to keep this look in my everyday life.
I think it's easy to be able to catch up the day and forget the really important thing for you.
So with the help of old and new friends transformed the wall of this abandoned house on a giant board and he painted on her sentences to <unk> "Before he died <unk>
So, <unk> could take a <unk> reflect on their lives and share personal aspirations in the public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment, but the next day the wall was filled and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
"Before I want to die I want to be <unk>  "Before you die I want to sit on the line of change <unk>
"Before I want to sing for millions of people."
"Before I die I want to plant a <unk>
"Before you die I want to live outside the <unk>
"Before I want to die I want to give you once more."
"Before I want to die I want to go to <unk>
"Before I want to die I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became <unk> and the dreams and the hopes of the people made me laugh at <unk> and they gave me comfort in hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new ways and <unk> it's about giving the reflection of the reflection and the <unk> and to remember what is most important for us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year and I started getting hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
So with my colleagues in the civic center, we made a kit, and now they have been done in countries around the world, like <unk> South Africa, Australia, Argentina and beyond.
Together we proved the power of our public spaces if they give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have are time and our relationships with other people.
In our age of distractions in increasing it is more important than ever, to find the ways of preserving the perspective and remembering that life is brief and <unk>
The death is something that we often avoid talking about, or even thinking, but I understood that preparing for death is one of those things that make us more power.
It's going to think about death -- our life.
Our shared spaces can reflect better what we care as individuals and as community and with more media to share hope, fears and stories, the people around us cannot only help improve places, it can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a single request.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my siblings.
<unk> is 22 and very <unk>
Don't speak, but it makes joy better than some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love.
<unk> shares the pass what happens.
It's not <unk> You don't look at the color of the skin.
They don't care about religious differences and notice it is never <unk>
When I sing songs, of our childhood, trying to tell you words that I couldn't even believe -- it reminds me of one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful it must be the unknown.
Samuel is 16 years old. It's very hot.
<unk> the most <unk> memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if he stole my <unk> but it reminds me of the year that he came out every single songs of my iPod, conversations that we kept when I was four years old, getting her pee on my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and the Lady Lady birthday.
It doesn't seem that amazing?
But most people don't agree.
And in fact, because your minds do not fit into the <unk> concept of society, often they're <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, even though that was the case, although you didn't consider them within it, that could only mean one thing -- which was <unk> <unk> and extraordinary.
Now, for those more familiar with the term <unk> is a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes the physical skills.
In each individual it manifests itself in a different way, from there that <unk> is so different from Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, is diagnosed with a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the developmental disorders that faster in the world, there is no cause no <unk>
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without it.
I was just three years old when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new being in my life.
When a few months, I realized that he was different.
<unk> a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies and in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at all.
<unk> lived and <unk> in his own world, with their own rules, and he was pleasure in the smallest things, like putting car cars around the room, looking at the washing machine and eat anything that was in the <unk>
As I grew up, it gets more different, and the differences were getting more guilty.
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and the <unk> <unk> had something really <unk> an innocent nature of a child who saw the world without <unk> a human being that there was never <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been some difficult moments in my family, moments in which I wish they were just like me.
But I look back at the things that I've taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I realize that they're things that I wouldn't want to change by normality.
The normal is going through the beauty that give us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that some of you are wrong.
It just means there's a different view of what is right.
If I could get a single thing to <unk> and to Sam and say, it would be that they don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences that <unk> are a <unk> Each of us has a gift in your inside and, honestly, search for normal is the ultimate sacrifice of potential.
The opportunity for <unk> progress and change dies at the time that we try to be like others.
Please. Don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit of what must have been <unk> in the country of <unk>
Penn State asked me to me, a computer teacher who gave a class of communication to engineering students.
I was scared.  <unk> <unk> of these students with his big minds and his big books and his big unknown books and <unk>
But in fact, those conversations, I felt what <unk> had had felt when he fell through the <unk> hole and saw the door of a new world.
I felt like that I sat when I had those conversations with the students, I was surprised the ideas that they had, and I wanted other people to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to open that door is a great communication.
We desperately need a huge communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones who are attacking our biggest challenges from energy to the environment and health care -- and if we don't know we don't understand this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as we didn't have these interactions.
But these big conversations cannot happen if our scientists and engineers are invited to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please get <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that your science is sexy and that his engineering is attractive.
First question for <unk> and then what?
<unk> why science is relevant to us.
Don't tell us that they study the <unk> but they study the <unk> which are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and to treat <unk>
And when you're describing your science, <unk> with <unk>
<unk> is an obstacle to our understanding of their ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why not say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same thing as making them <unk>
On the contrary, as Einstein, that everything is as simple as possible, but it doesn't simple.
They can clearly communicate your science without compromise ideas.
One thing to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies -- they are ways to hook up and engage with their content.
And by presenting their work, forget about the signs of <unk>
Have you wondered why they call <unk>  What do you do the <unk>
A <unk> like this is not just boring, but it supports too much in the language area of our brain and we were <unk>
Instead, this <unk> of <unk> Brown is much more effective, shows that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that really inspired the only single design of the <unk> Tower of the <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple phrase <unk> that the public can understand if you lose a little bit, and then provide graphics that will lead to our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding what they would be.
I think these are just some key ones that can help everyone else open the door and see the country of wonders that is science and engineering.
And so scientists and engineers, when you've solved this equation, for all media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words of all of English English is <unk>
Just because it sounds very well.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Although there was an editor in the 19th century that defined the very much better when he said, "A <unk> is the one that looks for a public charge no matter of <unk> platform or beginning, and when wins, gets it through the mere use of a monumental <unk>
I have no idea what it means <unk>
Something to do with the words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis of politics, and that all politicians know they have to try to master the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, <unk> that British Parliament allowed the newspapers to quote the exact words that were said in the <unk> camera.
And all of this was because of the courage of a guy with the old name of <unk> <unk> who was confronted by the <unk>
They put it in the Tower of London and he <unk> him, but he had enough courage to deal with them, and at the end he had such a popular support in London that I won.
And only a few years later, we had the first recorded use of the phrase <unk> <unk> as well as <unk> <unk>
Most people think it's true.
It's not. It's for a freedom advocate for expression.
But to really show you how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to America right after independence.
So, they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, his leader.
You didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a <unk>
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
They were introduced all kinds of suggestions that could have <unk>
Some people wanted to call it <unk> <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> of the <unk> of the American <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some of them just wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was about <unk>
And it was not even that they were <unk> they had the idea that you could be elected King by a given date.
And there could be <unk>
Everyone got tired of it, because this debate was <unk> for three weeks.
I read the newspaper of a poor <unk> and always <unk> <unk> with this <unk>
Which caused the <unk> and the <unk> was that the House of itself was against the <unk>
The House of <unk> didn't want Washington to <unk> power.
They didn't want to call him the King of whether he was giving him or his old ideas.
So, they wanted to give the title more <unk> <unk> <unk> and more unfortunate than it was happened.
And that title was <unk>
President. They didn't invent the title. Since there was been before, but it only meant <unk> that <unk> a <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I had no more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were presidents <unk> of little <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> -- but it was really a meaningless.
And so the Senate <unk>
They said, "It's ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign treaties and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who will take a serious title with a ridiculous degree and <unk> like President of <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate didn't <unk>
We can learn three interesting things about this.
First of all, and this is my favorite to where I've been able to figure out the Senate has never <unk> the title of President.
President Barack Obama is lucky enough to follow there, hoping that the Senate among in action.
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says a measure is <unk>  <unk> possible that we keep waiting for <unk>
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important thing, and this is the title of President of America doesn't sound at all as modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear heads to disposal, the largest economy in the world and a floating floating floating floating and so on.
The reality and the story has endowed with the title of <unk>
So at the end, I won the <unk>
They got their title of <unk>
And also the other concern of the Senate, appearance appearance -- well, it was a uniqueness then.
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
And everything because they want to sound like the guy who has the 5,000 nuclear <unk> etc.
So, at the end of the Senate won and the House of <unk> <unk> because nobody is going to feel humble when you tell them that now are President of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and that I would like to <unk>
Politicians are trying to choose and use words to shape and control the reality, but actually they actually change it much more the words than what they might change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to feet under land in a illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is full of heat and dust and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that talk about, but mostly that cacophony of male <unk> and stones with primitive.
Like others, I carry a <unk> cheap light, he holds my head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely distinguish the <unk> branches that hold the walls of that hole in a meter that drops hundreds of meters on the ground.
He <unk> my hand and suddenly I remember a <unk> who I met days before, who lost control and dropped <unk> feet on that hole.
As I talk to you today, these men are in the deep way of that hole in their lives without paying and reward and often dying.
I went out of that hole, and I went home, but they might never be will.
In the last 28 years, I was documenting native cultures in over 70 countries in six continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> in the Peace <unk>
Among all the amazing people that I met there at a <unk> <unk> the <unk> an NGO that is dedicated to eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and, actually, I started learning about slavery because I knew there existed in the world, but not just grade.
When we finished talking to me, I felt very happy to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
It was <unk> my stomach and weeks later, I flew Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
So I started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I've been in many of these places.
Some of them even considered my second home.
But this time, <unk> the dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation says that there are more than 27 million people in the world.
It's twice the number of Africans displaced throughout the entire slaves <unk>
150 years ago, the cost of a slave slave was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of <unk> <unk> today.
However, you can be enslaving entire families for generations for <unk> <unk>
<unk> slavery generates more than <unk> billion dollars a year around the world.
Many have been <unk> with fake <unk> promises of good education and better work to then discover that they're forced to work without pay, under the threat of violence and they cannot escape.
Today slavery operates in the <unk> the goods produced by slaves have value, but those who produce them are disposable people.
<unk> exists all over the world, and yet it's illegal in the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the brick <unk>
This strange and <unk> show was like entering the old Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> in a temperature of 54 degrees men, women, children -- in fact, entire families -- they were mechanically mechanically mechanically bricks in their heads, until 18 at the time, and they take them from <unk> to trucks that are hundreds of feet.
<unk> by <unk> and <unk> work silent, doing this task again and again for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There was no coffee party to eat, not to drink, and the severe <unk> I was just quite <unk>
So <unk> were the heat and the dust that my camera was too hot to the touch and stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean the team and make it work with air conditioning to <unk> and, sitting there, I was thinking, I was thinking, my camera gets a much better treatment than these people.
Back in the <unk> I wanted to cry but the <unk> who was on my side quickly grabbed me and said, "You don't do it. Don't do it here."
And he explained to me that I'll demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not only for me but for them.
I couldn't make it any direct aid.
I couldn't give you money, anything.
I wasn't a citizen of that country.
I could put them in a situation worse than they were.
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and working within the system by the release and she trusted that he <unk>
In terms of me, I waited to get home to feel my heart heart.
In the Himalayas, I found children carrying stones for miles on <unk> <unk> to trucks that were waiting down.
Those big <unk> were more heavy than the children who had charge and children would send them to their heads with <unk> <unk> made of <unk> ropes and <unk>
It's hard to witness something that <unk>
How can we influence something that <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know that they're slaves -- and they work 16 -- 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been all of his life.
They have nothing to <unk>
When these villagers were <unk> the <unk> they had literally had their houses.
When you hear the word slavery often we thought about sexual school and because of this global awareness that warned me that it would be difficult for me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I was inspired by women who had been previously <unk> sex.
It was led to me on a little stairs which was given to this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was a restaurant.
<unk> as you know in the craft, are local <unk>
They have small rooms rooms, where they are <unk> with their girls and children, some of them just seven years -- they're forced to entertain customers and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Each of it is dark and <unk> identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse of their customers.
On the <unk> I remember having a sense of <unk> <unk> and in that moment, I barely could imagine what it should be stuck in that hell.
I just had a <unk> on the stairs where they <unk>
There was no <unk>
There was no windows like to <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and, because you touch a very difficult issue, it's important to point out that slavery, even sexual traffic is happening around us.
There are hundreds of <unk> people in agriculture, in <unk> in the domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 Americans are sold every year as sex.
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
<unk> are another activity that often relate to the labor of <unk>
I went to Indian villages where there were entire families in the trade of silk.
This is a family portrait of family.
<unk> hands are the father of the father, the blue and red, and in the red of their children.
<unk> <unk> in these large barrels and <unk> silk in the liquid to the <unk> but <unk> is <unk>
My performer told me his stories.
"We have no <unk> they said.
We still hope, however, can be able to get out of this house someday and go to another place where we really pay us for our job."
It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 <unk> children in Lake <unk> the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we arrived, I was going to look very quickly.
I saw what seemed to be a fishermen family in a boat, two older children, some younger children makes sense, right?
<unk> They were all slaves.
The children are separated from their families and <unk> and forced to work <unk> with a set of boats in the lake, despite not knowing swim.
This child is eight years old.
When our boat came up to me was <unk> that his little canoe was <unk>
He was paralyzed by the fear of falling into water.
<unk> branches of trees submerged in Lake <unk> <unk> often catch networks and children, <unk> and fear, the water will be thrown into the branches.
A lot of <unk>
Since remember, it's always been forced to work on the lake.
Because of fear of her love is not going to run and like all life has been treated with cruelty, <unk> tries to the younger slaves under his command.
I met these guys at five o'clock in the morning when they took the last networks, but they had been working from a single day.
On the cold night and <unk>
And it would point out that these networks weigh over 400 pounds when they're packed with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village of fishermen.
I met it in a refuge in which the <unk> <unk> <unk> victims of slavery.
Kofi symbolizes is possible.
Who will get to be because somebody decided to make a difference in your life?
<unk> by a road in Ghana with partners in <unk> the <unk> a fellow <unk> with their <unk> suddenly accelerated and <unk> our car and played the window.
We asked us to do it on a path of land to the jungle.
At the end of the way, we were going to get out of the car, and he asked the driver to come up quickly.
And then he pointed out this path just visible and said, "This is the way, this is the road.
As we started down, we removed the <unk> and after walking around about an hour we found that the way I was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the photos of photos on my head as they <unk> in these waters to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> road ended up <unk> in a clear, and we had in front of a mass of holes that could fit into a football field, and they were all filled with <unk> workers.
A lot of women had kids who had children tied to their backs and while they were looking for gold, <unk> in <unk> water.
<unk> is used in the <unk> process.
These <unk> are <unk> in a well in a very part of Ghana.
When they came out of the well they were <unk> in their own sweat.
I remember looking at his little tired, <unk> because many had been under land for 72 hours.
<unk> are up to 90 feet and these people carry out heavy heavy bags that then will be shipped to another area where they were putting the stone to be able to extract the gold.
In the first view, the site seems to be filled with strong men and <unk> but if you look closer to the margin -- we see it to work at other lucky and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, disease and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> will end up like this victim of tuberculosis and from <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died he took him to work with him in mines.
When the uncle will die their uncle, we <unk> the debt of the uncle that force it to be a slave in mines.
When I met her, I worked in the 14 years and the injury of the leg that you see here is a product of a crash in the <unk> so serious doctors said that I should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis and yet to that, he's forced to work night and day in that mine.
Yet, he dream with being liberated and educated with local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of determination, in <unk> to a remote, remote, which inspires me a lot of respect.
I want to throw light on slavery.
Did you know their images would be seen by you all over the world.
I wanted to know that we're going to give up witness to them and make everything possible to help change their lives.
I really believe that if we can see ourselves some other as human beings, then it becomes very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not from magazines. These are people, like you and like you, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There is no day that I don't think about these so many beautiful people that I've had the great honor to know.
I hope these images wake up a force in which you see you see in people like you, and I hope that force will turn up a fire and that fire will turn into the slavery because without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I make math math and there's a particular problem for the <unk> we are like <unk>
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So today, I'm going to try to explain to you what I do.
The dance is one of the most human activities.
We were <unk> the <unk> and the dancers of <unk>  that we'll see more forward.
But ballet demand for a degree of extraordinary training -- a high level of skill and probably some <unk> initial <unk> that well can have a genetic component.
Unfortunately, the neurological disorders like Parkinson's Parkinson's -- they destroy gradually this extraordinary ability, as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, at his time, it was a virtuous one of ballet ballet.
Over the last few years has been successful in the treatment.
However, there are <unk> million people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with a <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need <unk> tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective and ultimately, the only way we'll know if there is actually a cure to be when we have an objective measure and <unk>
But it's frustrating that for Parkinson's and other disorders of movement have no <unk> and so they don't have the blood analysis and the best we have is a neurological exam for 20 minutes.
You have to go to a clinic to do it. It's very, very expensive, and that means that outside of clinical trials, they never do.
What if patients could do it at home?
That would save a <unk> trip to the clinic. What if patients could do it ourselves?
It didn't need personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the <unk> clinic.
So what I want to do is like not a conventional way for a try, you see, in a certain sense, all of us are <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration of vibrating strings.
It shows somebody healthy as it emits sounds at the talk, and we can imagine as a dancers of a happy background, because we have to coordinate all these vocal organs to produce sounds, and we all have the gene -- the <unk> for example.
And as the ballet school, it requires a <unk> level.
Let's think of time that leads to a child learn to speak.
From the sound, we can track the position of vocal strings.
On the bottom line you can see an example of irregular <unk> of vibrating strings.
We see the same <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these exams based on the voice with the clinical trials -- well, they're both not <unk>
The neurological test is not <unk> both use the existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do it.
They are both <unk> OK, but in addition to <unk> exams are not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They do very quickly, take about 30 seconds a lot.
They're minimal and we all know what happens is happening.
When something takes a cost so <unk> it appears at a massive scale.
These are some incredible lists to address.
We can reduce the raw difficulties of patients.
It would not make the clinic to go to the clinic for <unk>
<unk> <unk> we could get data data.
We could do a massive mass of low cost for clinical trials, and for the first time, <unk> <unk> at the overall scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of disease before it's too late.
So in order to give the first steps in that sense, we are launching the <unk> <unk>
Along with <unk> and <unk> we want to register a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to tackle these goals.
We have local local lines for about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with no disease, can be <unk> and to stop recordings for about cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've already reached six percent of the goal in just eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly:  So let's take all of these samples of, say 10,000 people will be able to say who is healthy and who isn't it?
What do you take from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the call -- you have to indicate whether or not the disease. Yeah.
You see, some people can not <unk> You may not be able to do it.
But we're going to get a very large sample of data in different circumstances, and do it in different circumstances is important because we're looking for <unk> the factors of confusion for the real markers of disease.
TR: Do you have a snapshot accuracy at this point?
<unk> A lot more than that.
In fact, my graduate student, I have to <unk> has done a fantastic work and now it has shown that it works on mobile phone network, as well as the <unk>
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's a improvement.
<unk> Of course.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk> public.
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March of 2011, I was doing <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We're <unk> creatures.
We were focusing on the darkness, in the rooms, and they generally avoid the solar light.
We do the <unk> models still more <unk> the perfect skin -- even more perfect -- we do the impossible and we were doing it in the press all of the time, but some of us are really artists with talent with many years of experience and a real taste of the images and photography.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, as the rest of the world, the <unk> events that happen in Japan.
Soon time later, an organization where I was <unk> where I was <unk> <unk> was in the place working as part of the <unk> team.
With hundreds of other volunteers we knew we couldn't stay sitting at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On May I traveled to <unk>
It's a small fishermen of <unk> in the <unk> of almost 50,000 people -- one of the first people affected by the wave.
The level of water has reached over 24 feet tall and more than three kilometers away inside.
As you can imagine, the people were <unk>
We had rubble from channels and <unk>
<unk> schools. We took the mud and left the houses to be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons of tons of dead fish and <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were <unk> and we loved it.
And so the volunteers like the neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and photos of photos and cameras and <unk>
Everybody did the same.
<unk> and bring them to different places of the villages around to <unk>
It wasn't until so I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that people had <unk>
As they were fleeing the wave, and to save their lives, they had to abandon absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week I started to help in a <unk> center of the people.
It helped clean toilets, giant <unk>
This place turned out to be the place in the village where the center of <unk> <unk> the photos.
And I had the honor of them and I had the honor that it was <unk> in me to clean the photos.
And this was exciting and inspiring, I had heard of the expression beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until it goes beyond my horizons that something happened.
When you look at the photos, I found some that had more than a hundred years old, they were still in the lab, I couldn't avoid thinking about how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I got on Facebook contacted some of them, and the next morning the answer was so overwhelming and positive that I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
It wasn't too <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl I had to do with a lot of precision and <unk>
In another way, that little girl would not have the aspect of it, and that would be as tragic as having the photo <unk>
Over the time of time, they got a little bit more <unk> and they needed more <unk> and so I went back to Facebook and <unk> and five days later, 80 people out of 12 people were offered to help.
At two weeks, I had 150 people on <unk>
In Japan, in July, we had to <unk> a village to the north of <unk>
Once at a week we use our scanner in the developing libraries that were <unk> where people were going to reclaim their pictures.
The time that <unk> in <unk> is a different story, dependent on the <unk> of the photos.
Could it be an hour. I could have a number of weeks.
Could it be months.
This <unk> had to draw pretty much by hand using a guide of the areas whose color and the water had no destroyed.
I took a long time.
The water destroyed all of these photos of it as much as a saltwater, saltwater, covered in bacteria, even with the seaweed, all of it along with the step of time, I continue to <unk> it was a major part of the project.
We couldn't afford the photo unless I was <unk> dry and had been <unk> by his <unk>
We were lucky enough with <unk>
We have a <unk> <unk>
It's very easy to harm the photos even more <unk>
As he said once he said, the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought these pictures was really lucky in the photos.
He had started <unk> her same but stopped to realize that the <unk> even more.
It also had <unk>
Without them, the images of her husband and his own face would not have been able to reconstruct the images in a single photo and <unk> the whole picture.
When they picked up their pictures a little shared one of his story with us.
A few colleagues from her husband found the pictures in a fire station between the rubble quite far away from where they used to be their house, but his colleagues would <unk>
The day of the tsunami, his husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave,
He had to go inside the water while the <unk> <unk>
Their young children, not so small now, but their two children were at school, in different schools.
One of them was caught in the water.
He took a week to find his whole family and knowing that everybody was survived.
The day I gave him his pictures his little boy who was 14 years old.
For her, despite all this, those pictures were the best gift I could tell you something that he could go back to look, something that I could remember from the past that would not have been marked on the past day, when everything in his life changed or was destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined up to where hundreds of them were helped to clean up more of <unk> photographs -- the great <unk> -- the big <unk> -- the vast majority of the hands were <unk>
More than 500 volunteers around the world helped us bring back to 90 families hundreds of fully <unk> photos and <unk>
Over this time, we don't really spend more than a thousand in teams and materials, most of the ink for <unk>
We take pictures all the time.
A picture is a memory of someone or something, a relationship, somebody loved it.
They are <unk> of our memories and stories, the last thing that we would have to do -- but the first thing that we will try to look for.
So about this was the project to restore small pieces of humanity, to give someone their connection to the past.
When a picture like this gives someone, a huge difference in the life of the person that comes in.
This project also made a big difference in the life of <unk>
Some of them are connected with something larger with something bigger, to bring something, using their talent for something that are not properly thin skin models.
To finish my email I'd like to read this email -- I emailed it the day I came back from Japan after six months.
As I could, I couldn't avoid thinking about people and the stories shown in the images.
And one in particular, a picture with women of different ages from the grandmother to the small girl, gathering around a baby, <unk> me, because a little bit like a picture of my family my grandmother, my mother, and my <unk> daughter hangs out of our wall.
In the whole world, in all the few of our basic needs, right?
Thank you. 
<unk> <unk> were inspired by wonder and curiosity with this photo of a bullet who goes through an apple in an exhibition just one millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not a million times faster and to a thousand billion, but a trillion frames per second.
I present to you a new kind of <unk> <unk> a new technique that can create video in slow motion from light in motion.
And with that, we can create cameras that can see behind the <unk> beyond the imagery of vision, or seeing the inside of the body without using X-ray and <unk>
If I take a laser pointer and switch it into a second or a second thing, and it turns out in a second -- to create a <unk> package of just a millimeter wide <unk>
And that package of photons, that <unk> travel at the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a common bullet than a bullet in a half.
If we took that bullet and this <unk> <unk> <unk> in this bottle, how do you spread those photons into this <unk>
What is the light aspect of light in <unk>
Now, all of this --   Remember that all of this happens at least in a <unk> is what it takes to travel to the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so that you can see light in motion.
Coca-Cola is not <unk> this research.  <unk> a lot of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> comes into the bottle with an photons package that starts to <unk> and that inside, it starts to <unk>
Part of the light goes down to the table, and we started to see these <unk>
Many of the photons eventually come to the cap and then they explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble in air that bounces inside it.
At that time, the waves travel through the table, and because of the insights of the bottle, it looks at the bottom of the bottle, after several boxes, that the insights are <unk>
Now, if we take a bullet and present and we make it go through the same distance and we see it in slow motion to about 10 billion times, how much you think it would take us to sit in that movie?
One day? A week? Actually, a whole year.
It would be a very boring movie --  in a slow motion.
And what about how to test nature <unk>
You can see the waves that are <unk> from the table, the tomato and the wall of the bottom.
It's like throwing a stone on a pond.
It's the way nature paints a photo, I thought, from a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a full composition of it.
But if you look at once you look at this tomato <unk> you realize that, as the light gets rid of the <unk> it's still bright. They didn't get <unk>
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and the light bounces on its inside and it comes back after several <unk> of second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your phone, you're going to be able to go to the supermarket and check whether the fruit is grown without having to <unk>
So what do we create this camera in India?
As photographers, you know, if we take a <unk> picture, it gets very little light in.
But we're going to go a billion times faster than the shortest exhibition -- so I will barely get some light.
So we sent that <unk> that package of photons, millions of times, and we recorded over and over again with a very <unk> <unk> we took these <unk> data and <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of those data in raw and sort of interesting ways.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible, themselves.
And if a new power of a future <unk> would allow him to see after the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw away some light on the door. You start to go into the room, one part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera.
Where we could get those multiple light bulbs.
It's not science fiction. We've built it already.
On the left, it's our <unk>
Behind the wall is a <unk> and <unk> light on the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature <unk>
And a small fraction of the photons go back to the camera, but interestingly, in slightly different times.
And as we have a camera that works, our <unk> has unique capabilities.
It has very good <unk> and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances the distances and also the hidden objects to the hidden objects but we don't know what about a distance.
And when you project a laser can record a <unk> picture, which you see on the screen, it really doesn't make any sense.
But we will take a lot of images like this, tens of images, and we will try to look at the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we'll be able to see the object.
Can we see it <unk>
This is our reconstruction for us.
We have things to explore before we get this in the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that <unk> collisions with what is on the turn of the curve, the <unk>
Or we could search for survivors in dangerous conditions, looking at the light reflected by the open windows.
Or we could build <unk> able to see the inside of the body through <unk> and the same thing for <unk>
But of course, because of the tissue and the blood -- this is quite difficult, and so this is actually a request for scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new form of visualization to solve the problems in the next generation.
Just like <unk> <unk> himself a scientist, became the science of art, an art of photographs of them.
I realized that all of the <unk> of data that we collect every time are not only for scientific scientists, but we can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be <unk>
So creating a new form of computer photography with slow motion and color code.
And look at those waves over the time between each of those waves is just a couple of <unk>
But this is also something that happens to happen.
If you look at the waves under the <unk> these are going to go away from us.
The waves should move to us.
What happens here?
So it turns out, as we're recording almost at the speed of light, we have very weird effects. A would have loved to see this image.
The order of events occur in the world sometimes has been invested in the camera.
They would take the corresponding <unk> of space and time, we can correct this <unk>
It's time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile phone can <unk> your life, and gives you freedom to you.
With a mobile phone, you can put a crime of humanity in Syria.
With a mobile phone, you can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt.
With a mobile phone, you can record a song, and you can put it right.
All of this is possible with a cell phone.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and I live in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that moment, to this city.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people have been involved in search of change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all these people gathering that they were looking for a change, they had a mobile phone in your pocket.
Who would have a mobile phone here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile phone.
<unk> A Android, a Blackberry, wow!
It's a lot. Almost everybody today has a cell phone.
But today I'm going to talk about my mobile, and how I changed my life.
I'll talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> pieces of information.
And data in gross.
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the E.U. Commission presented a <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
This directive says that every company company, every single company <unk> every single Internet provider has to store a wide range of user information.
Who calls <unk> Who sends an email to <unk>
Who sends a text to <unk>
And if we use your phone, where we are.
All of this information is stored by at least six months, and to two years, in their phone company or their telephone experience?
And in all Europe people stood up and said, "We want this."
They said they didn't want this <unk>
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the carriers and the Internet providers -- all this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, everybody said, "We want this."
And here you can see about 10,000 people that came out to the streets of Berlin and they said, <unk> not <unk>
And some of them even said this would be <unk> 2.0.
The <unk> was the secret police of Eastern Germany in the East age.
And I also wondered if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time I use your <unk>
So I asked my phone phone, <unk> <unk> who at that time was the largest telephone company in Germany, which please give me all the information they had about me.
And I asked them once, and I went back to them, and I didn't get a concrete answer, it was all <unk>
But then I said, "I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to take a court lawsuit because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we're not going to give you this information.
At the end, they <unk> OK.
<unk> the demand and they send me the information that I would <unk>
Meanwhile, the <unk> Court failed the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly little bit about brown with a CD inside.
And on the CD there was this.
Thirty thousand <unk> 30 lines of information.
I first saw them, and I said, well, it's an enormous file, OK.
But after a while, I realized that it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
It was a little bit <unk> what should you do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I step at night, what I'm doing.
But then I said, I want this <unk> information.
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what the <unk>
So, next to <unk> <unk> and Open Data City, we did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and go ahead and go forward.
You can see every step I do.
And you can see how I'm going from <unk> on the train to <unk> and how often I call the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That gives a little scary.
But it's not just about me.
But all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she's called, we talked a couple of times.
And then they call me a few friends and they're called between them.
And then one calls the other, and the other one to the other, and we end up with this big network of communication.
You can see how your people communicate to each other and what time they call one another, what time they sleep.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society is.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who speaks with whom, who sends an email to whom, all of this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all these people in the streets in Berlin, in the fall of Berlin, they had a mobile phone in your pocket.
And the <unk> had known who was involved in this protest, and if the <unk> had known who the leaders, this never happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall of it might never happen.
And as a result, not the fall of <unk>
Because today the state agencies and companies want to store so much information from us as possible within and out of the web.
They want to have the chance to follow our lives and they want to be <unk> forever.
But <unk> and living in the digital age, is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight the <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When you go home to home to their friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century and it's not just <unk>
When you go home, you take your representative that only because companies and state agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what information you store from you.
So in the future, every time you use your mobile phones that you can to remember that they have to fight the <unk> in the digital age.
Thank you.
Hello, <unk> what happens?
It's not enough.
Hello, <unk> what happens?
I call myself <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor that brought me to the world.
And I would go to my mom six times in six different directions -- <unk> the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral <unk> that's why you take all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm like a mixture of <unk>
and Muhammad <unk>
The P. C. is not genetics.
It's not <unk> and it can't be <unk>
Nobody <unk> the uterus of my mother and not <unk> because my parents were brothers, though they are.
It's just about accidents, as the one that happened at birth.
Now, I'm going to tell you -- I'm not a source of inspiration. And I don't want any of the ones in the room.
I feel bad for me, because at some point in life, you wish you were a disabled time.
Let's go a walk.
<unk> <unk> are at the shopping center, drive in circles and what do you see?
16 empty places for disabled places.
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little bit <unk>
In addition, I tell you, I have 99 problems, and the P. C. is just one of them.
There was a <unk> of the <unk> I would win the gold medal.
I'm a Muslim <unk> and a <unk> and live in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, you might have to do it.
I'm in Park <unk> in New Jersey.
I always loved that my neighborhood and my disease had the same <unk>
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my home to New York, I would.
A lot of people with cerebral palsy, but my parents don't believe in <unk>
The mantra of my father was, "Can you <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my three sisters were going to be <unk>
If my three sisters were going to public school, my parents who went to the school system and <unk> that I was also outside -- and if we didn't take all of the ultimate note -- all of them had the <unk> of my mother.
My father taught me to walk the five years to put my <unk> on his feet and just walking.
Another storyline that I used was to hang a dollar in front of me to get it to it.
The <unk> that I carry in was very strong and so ...
Yes. The first day in kindergarten was walking like a <unk> champion who has received a lot of taps.
Growing up, there were only six Arabs in my city, and they were every family.
Now there are 20 Arabic -- and they're still being every family --  I think nobody realized we weren't <unk>
This was before 9/11 and the politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> to the <unk> as <unk>
The people I grew up with had no problems with my faith.
But it seemed to be a lot like a lot of hunger for death during the <unk>
I told them that it had enough fat fat to live three months without eating -- so I want to go from dawn at sunset is very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yes, in <unk> It's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford physical therapy -- so they sent me to the dance school.
I learned to dance with <unk> or whatever I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends used <unk> I would too.
And when my friends were going to spend the summer vacation on the coast of Jersey, I was not going.
I spent my summers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid if I don't go back to Palestine all the <unk> we were in <unk>
On the summer vacation often my father was trying to <unk> so I was drinking dry <unk> and I was drinking hot cups on his back, and I remember the water <unk> and I was thinking, <unk> <unk>
But <unk> cure was yoga.
I should say it's very boring, but before you do yoga was a <unk> comedian that I couldn't stand up with <unk> <unk>
And now I can focus on the head.
My parents got this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be in <unk> Hospital.
I went to college through the positive discrimination and I got a grant to the University of Arizona, because it was in all the <unk>
It was like the pet <unk> in the theater department.
And all of me <unk>
I did all the tasks of the least smart, I took the ultimate note in my classes, and also in their classes.
Every time I was doing a scene of the glass zoo my teachers <unk>
But I never got a paper.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to make a work called <unk> very slow in Jackson.
It's a piece of a girl with brain <unk>
I was a girl with brain <unk>
So I started screaming at the four <unk> <unk> <unk> will have a <unk>
I have <unk>
In order to be <unk> In order to <unk>
Thank God <unk> at the end I'm <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  They gave him <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running to the director of the theater, crying as if someone had killed my cat, to ask her why and she told me that because they believed that I couldn't do the risk scenes.
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the risk stunts I can't do the <unk>
It was a role for the one that I had literally been born and turned it into an actor without cerebral <unk>
The college was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> story of <unk> actors without disability for disabled papers.
When I went home, I went home, and my first tour, he was as extra in a <unk>
My dream became true.
And I knew it would be <unk> to <unk> <unk> friend in a <unk>
Instead, I stayed there as a <unk> and I didn't see it more than the <unk> and it was obvious to me that directors of <unk> not <unk> no white, no white, <unk>
They just hit perfect people.
But there was exceptions to the rule.
I grew up looking at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: they were <unk>
That's why I made me <unk>
In my first tour, it took famous comic of New York City to New Jersey, and I will never forget the face of the first comedian that took when he fell in the realization that I was going at high speed by the New Jersey <unk> with a driver that had brain <unk>
I worked in clubs across the United States, and also in Arabic in Arabic in the Middle East, without <unk> and <unk>
Some people say I am the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know you never heard that little disgusting rumor that says that women are not fun, and they find it quite fun.
In 2003, my brother brother brother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> Festival of New York, now in his 10 year.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in the media and to remind you of directors of <unk> that <unk> and Arabic is not <unk>
It was much easier to fight Arabs were much easier to fight the challenge of stigma from disability.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was like invited to the medical news program, it has Keith <unk>
I stood as if I went to a graduate graduate school, I went to a study, and they sat me in a wheelchair.
I looked at the director and I said, <unk> can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I cling to the desk desk to not go out of the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
I had my opportunity and the <unk> I knew I didn't get to me.
But not only Mr. <unk> came back to <unk> but I was just as a participant in full time and pasted my chair.
Something fun I learned in direct with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
It says that children are <unk> but they never get away from me or a girl or a little girl.
Suddenly, my disability on the Internet became <unk>
<unk> clips online with comments like, "Why <unk>
"It is <unk>
And my favorite <unk> <unk> terrorist <unk>
What does this mean?
We really should pray for it.
And a <unk> suggested I would even add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as race.
If someone in the wheelchair can't make <unk> then <unk> you can't make someone in the wheelchair.
<unk> are the <unk> Yes, <unk> man.
<unk> are the largest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
And the doctors said that I don't get <unk> but I'm here in front of you.
However, I have grown up with the media, I don't think we could.
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in media and everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images, that <unk> less hate on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
We even need the entire society to teach our kids well.
My <unk> journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I came to <unk> by the red carpet by the <unk> of the <unk> Susan <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk>
I came to act in a film with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> the incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the Arab world have become <unk>
I was <unk> in terms of the great state of New Jersey state in the <unk> of 2008.
And I started <unk> a charity for charity to give the Syrian refugee children, to Palestinians very much of what my parents would do.
It was the only time my father saw me live in live, and I do this talk to his memory.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
I call myself <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a kid in a small town.
I don't know their name, but I know their story.
She lives in a little town to the South <unk>
This village is near <unk>
<unk> drives the small people to poverty and the edge of the <unk>
Without anything for him there, it's going to the big city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there are no job, no job, no <unk>
He's just living in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
After maybe a year <unk> nothing.
One day you get a guy who offered him to <unk> after dinner, to <unk>
He meets a dynamic group of people, who gives you a break.
It gets a little bit of money to buy new clothes, money to send home your family.
They show him a young guy.
They finally home.
It starts a new life.
It has a real goal.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky, <unk> a bomb.
That child of that little village with dreams of the great city was the <unk> bomber and that dynamic group of people were the <unk> a terrorist organization connected to al Qaeda.
So how the story of a child of a young people trying to fulfill their dreams in the city ends with him <unk>
He was waiting.
I was waiting for an opportunity, hoping to start his future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing that I did.
This was the first thing that he took out of what we call the <unk>
And their story repeated in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> young people that were <unk> riots in <unk> <unk> riots in London, looking for something beyond <unk> <unk>
For the young people, the promise of city, the great dream of city is the opportunity, for well-being, but the young people participate in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth who suffers from the highest <unk> rates.
By 2030, three of five people living in cities are going to be under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if you don't give them opportunities for the story of the <unk> of <unk> the door of access to terror, to violence, to <unk> to be the story of 2.0 cities.
And in my hometown of birth, <unk> 70 percent of the young people are <unk>
70 percent don't work, it's not going to school.
They don't have nothing.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the hospital Hospital.
I remember going to that hospital <unk> to <unk> thinking, "Well, if I had never gone?
And if I'd seen me forced to be in that same <unk> <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to support about youth leaders at a business rate.
They went to about 90 youth leaders.
We sat down and we had a rain of ideas about solutions to the great challenges that the city faces.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He was at the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no job, no opportunity.
I remember when he told me, because I was a college student, <unk> frustrated, was the perfect white for Al <unk> and other terrorist organizations to be <unk>
They were looking for people like it.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to the B is the streets.
<unk> years of civil war, have completely destroyed the traffic system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
He started a company of <unk>
He started <unk> <unk> to local residents who normally couldn't <unk>
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of her family and friends, and his dream is at some time to expand hundreds of motorcycles over the next three years.
Why is this story?
What does this story different?
I think their ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the corporate spirit, and I think that business spirit can be the most powerful tool against the <unk> of <unk>
They were giving young people to be the creators of the economic opportunities that are looking so far.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was <unk> to train some of the young people at the height of corporate initiative and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen in more than 22 years ago, and until Mohamed arrived, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were from plastic from the overseas.
If you give someone, "When was the last time you saw flowers <unk>
For those who grew up during the civil war, the answer was <unk>
So, Mohamed saw an opportunity.
He started a company of <unk> and <unk> design.
I created a farm on the outskirts of <unk> and he started growing <unk> and <unk> who said, they could survive the hard weather of <unk>
And it started the delivery of flowers for materials, creating gardens in the homes, and the companies of the city, and now is working in the creation of the first public park in <unk> in 22 years.
There is no public parks in <unk>
He wants to create a space where the families, the young people, can go together, and as he says, smell the pink <unk>
By the way, he's not rose pink because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire the young people, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought to start a business.
They had thought about working for a NGOs, working for the government, but their history, their innovation, really had a strong impact on them.
He forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
They encouraged them to believe that they might be entrepreneurs, that they could be <unk>
For the end of the day, they had innovative solutions for some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
<unk> business solutions for local problems.
So, inspire young people to create a culture of corporate spirit -- it's really a great step, but young people need capital to make their ideas reality.
They need expertise and orientation to <unk> in development and put it in their business.
<unk> young people with the resources that they need -- they need the support that they need to move from conception to creation, and will create <unk> to the urban growth.
For me, corporate spirit is something more than starting a business.
It's creating a social impact.
Mohamed not just selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
Their Park <unk> so this is how it is called, when it is created, when it's created, to transform the way people see their city.
<unk> hired kids from the street to help rent and keep <unk>
He gave them the opportunity to escape <unk> <unk> <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is, to become young people in entrepreneurs, <unk> and eat their <unk> innovation and they will have more stories about flowers and Parks of Peace and <unk> and <unk> of <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the <unk> <unk> an area in Northern New York City.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest <unk>
The sun was making the leaves like a <unk> and not to be on the way that we could <unk> almost we could pretend that we were the first human beings to step on that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a shed in a <unk> with a beautiful lake <unk> when I discovered something nasty.
Behind the shed there was a <unk> of about four square feet with heart hearts -- balls of aluminum <unk> balls and <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> that were too lazy to pull out what they thought they were going to clean up with their <unk>
And that question followed with me, and it was a little bit.
Who cleans our <unk>
No matter how a <unk> or where they <unk> the <unk> who cleans our trash in <unk>
Who cleans our trash in Rio or in Paris or <unk>
Here in New York City, the <unk> Department of <unk> is our trash, <unk> tons of waste and two tons of <unk> products every day.
I wanted to know that as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What does it feel to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and walked through their trajectories and I interviewed people in offices and facilities across the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I need to get more to get more.
So I started working as <unk>
Now I didn't just travel on trucks.
And he operated the mechanical Park, the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
They all ask about smell.
It's there, but it's not as lame as you believe, and in the days that it's very strong -- you will be very quickly <unk>
It costs a lot of used to weight.
I met people who had worked on it for a number of years, and their bodies were still following the weight of getting on their body tons of garbage every week.
It's also <unk>
According to the Office of the Infinity <unk> the collection collection is one of the ten <unk> more dangerous than the country, and I learned why.
You're going out and entering the traffic all day and pass through you around you.
They just want to <unk> so the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for the <unk>
And also the garbage is full of dangers that often fall from the truck and cause terrible damage to them.
I also learned about how relentless the trash.
When you get out of <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that garbage is as a force of nature itself.
It never leaves come.
It's also like a form of breathing or circulation.
It always must be in motion.
And it's also the stigma.
It seems that stigma is especially ironic because I think the <unk> of waste is the most important workforce on the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They're the first <unk> of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste in the efficient way and effective every day, this starts to take away from their containers and their dangers inherent to us in very real ways.
For decades we had controlled for decades and centuries back and start <unk>
The economy needs it.
If we can't get rid of the old thing we don't have room for what the drivers of the economy begin to fail when it's in danger the consumption of the economy.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, just to point out the relationship.
And then what I call our average average speed necessary.
So I mean just at the speed where we used to move in the <unk>
We usually don't get <unk> and we don't have to pay it to us our coffee cup of coffee, our <unk> <unk>
We use them -- we <unk> we forget about them, because we know that there's a job force on the other side that is caused by it.
So today, I want to suggest to you a couple of ways of thinking about waste waste that maybe help reduce stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
Her work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're on the street every day, <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
Do you know when to <unk>
And their work allows us to do our own.
They're almost a way of relief.
The flow that they keep us apart from ourselves, from our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow must always stay in one way or another.
One day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a waste collection of waste on the street, grabbed my little son, I went down the stairs and there was a man doing his journey of recycled paper as I did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank you for doing his work that particular day, but I started to cry.
And he looked at me and just <unk> and said, "We're going to be fine.
We're going to be right."
Soon after that, I began to research the waste collection and I went back to see that man.
It's called <unk> we work together, and we got good friends.
I want to believe that <unk> was right.
We're going to be fine.
But in our efforts by <unk> the way we exist on this planet as species we have to include and have to account every cost -- even the very real human cost of the labor of labor.
The city waste, what we think when we talk about garbage represent three percent of the waste of the nation.
It's a remarkable statistic as a remarkable.
So in the flow of their days and their lives, the next thing that you see someone whose work is to clean up the trash of you, <unk> a moment to <unk>
<unk> a moment to tell you very much.
My work is focused on the connection to thinking about our community life, forming a part of the environment where architecture is born naturally from conditions and local traditions.
I brought two recent projects like this.
Both projects are located in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that different analysis from different perspectives becomes an essential part of the end of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a shopping center of several floors in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis <unk>
This is the kind of building that showed us like example, my team and me, about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to go out <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city we realized there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people can't afford to buy things.
Secondly, you need to employ a lot of energy because the crystals with <unk> generates heat into the interior, so it takes a lot of <unk>
In a city where this shouldn't happen because it's about a warm weather that goes from 20 to 25 degrees during the entire year.
And thirdly, what does it look like is nothing to do with Africa or Ethiopia.
It's a worth of being so rich in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really <unk> with the old market that is this structure to the free market where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to little <unk>
There's also that idea of using the public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that was what I really wanted to design, not a commercial center.
But the question was how to build a modern building, of a number of stories, applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented to the site of the site, which is located in an area of a lot of growth in the city, where a lot of the buildings that we now see in the image, didn't exist.
And it's also between two streets parallel that they don't communicate in an extension of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, <unk> all the entries from the building.
And this goes out with a <unk> <unk> which creates a space to open air in the building that goes through its own way, the sun and rain.
And around this space we've applied the idea of the market with small businesses, that changes on each floor because of the way of space.
I also thought, how to close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that supports the local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a fabric like a concrete shell, with <unk> to allow the air, and also of the light, but in a <unk> way.
And then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons in their <unk>
They have the properties of fractal geometry, and this helped me model <unk>
We're building that with these little <unk> pieces that are the windows that leave the air and the light in a way the inside of the building.
This is <unk> with these little colors of colors that use the sunlight inside the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas it was not very easy to convince developers because they thought, "That's not a commercial center, it wasn't a commercial center.
But finally, we all realized that this idea of the market was to be much more profitable than the commercial center of the mall because at the end of the day, there were more local to sell.
And then the idea of the facade was much more economic -- not only because of the material compared to the glass, but also because it was no longer necessary to have air conditioning.
So we got certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the power of energy for the building in a city where electricity is cut almost every day.
So we got a great advantage by putting it on the ceiling.
And then under those panels we think about the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this <unk>
And these <unk> on the roof, we collect water for the <unk>
They are waiting for the beginning of the next year, because we go through the fifth floor of the building floor.
The second example is a master of 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to do a big project, the biggest thing that I have designed, it needed not only understanding the city of Tunisia, but also its environment, his tradition and culture.
During that analysis, I put special attention in <unk> a <unk> structure of <unk> that was surrounded by a dozen <unk> doors connected by almost straight lines.
When I went to place, the first operation of design that we did was extend the streets existing streets, creating 12 initial blocks similar to the size and features in Barcelona and other cities of Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we choose some strategic spots in relation to the idea of the doors of doors with straight lines, and this altered the initial model.
And the last operation was to think about the cell, the little cell in the project, like the apartment, as the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in the <unk> climate.
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore a natural ventilation.
So they <unk> a scheme that claims that most apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that it's almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these <unk> blocks and then in the lower plant, we have all the connections to the pedestrians.
And it also responds to local norms that they set up a higher density at higher levels and lower levels in the lower plant.
And it reinforces this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost as giving the community to the busy space of construction.
It's where all the neighbors, can go up and forth and make activities, such as running a mile race in the morning, or to jump from one building to another.
These two examples, have a common approach to design process.
And also, they're in emerging countries, where you can see the cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in the life of people changes the communities and local economies at the same rate that the buildings.
So for this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions, but <unk> that improves the relationship between the community and the environment, and they have a goal to connect the nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl joined our class. It was as remarkable, as all the new girls.
I had a lot of very bright hair and a little <unk> of pencils and cute. It was super strong for the capitals of states, very good for <unk>
And I ended up that year, and I was full of jealousy until I <unk> my sinister plan.
One day I stayed a time after the <unk> I was a little afternoon and I hid in the bathroom in the girls.
When the coast was <unk> salt, I walked into the classroom, I took from the table of my teacher <unk>
And then I did.
I was able to get the ratings from my <unk> just a little bit, just some way.
All the way --  And I set up the book to the <unk> but to see, some of my fellow colleagues had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put them all rows of <unk> and myself just a row of it, just for being there, because I was there.
I'm still surprised what I did.
I don't understand how the idea.
I don't understand why I felt good doing it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I would never get me.
It's that everything was obvious <unk>
I will never tell me.
But most of all, I was fascinated by the reason why I was bothered by this little little girl -- so small enough to <unk>
So the jealousy.
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know babies suffer from jealousy.
Also primates. The birds are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause of sales in the U.S.
And yet, I've never seen a study that <unk> the loneliness, or the <unk> or the sadness.
So you have to go to the fiction, because novels are like the lab where they are studying them in every single possible way.
In fact, I don't know whether it's an exaggeration to say that if it was not supposed to happen, there would be no literature.
Well, he wouldn't have <unk> the <unk> would have no <unk>
There would be no king <unk> or <unk> and <unk>
No Shakespeare.
<unk> the reading lists of high school, because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> there would be no <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Without jealousy there is no <unk> I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and in terms of the jealousy, it almost has all of them.
This year is to be 100 years of their work -- "In looking at the <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also the ordinary <unk> -- my own, my whole thing we could have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details -- right?
We think of a kid trying to reconcile sleep.
We think about a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forgot how hard that is.
We forgot how relentless it is.
I mean, this is the books that Virginia <unk> said were as hard as <unk>
I don't know what the cat does, but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and the <unk> and the <unk> and <unk>
It's going to be very obvious as the reporters that are reduced to the person, their desire, to their <unk> are a narrative base base.
I don't know. I think we get very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel jealousy, we tell ourselves a story.
One story about people's lives, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel wrong.
Being <unk> and audience, we know exactly what details were going to look at the <unk> right?
<unk> make us all <unk> <unk> and that's something that I was trying to understand.
All she does to give me pleasure could give you pleasure to the other, maybe right now."
And it starts to say itself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every fresh charm that <unk> it detects in his <unk> adds up to its collection of instruments of torture in her private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, <unk> <unk> would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break up with it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's a tough job. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's an <unk> <unk> You need to be <unk>
And how are the <unk>
<unk> are <unk> of information.
<unk> use the details.
<unk> they like the great amounts of bright hair, and the cute little <unk> <unk>
<unk> came out of the photos.
That's why Instagram is so successful --  <unk> links well the <unk> language with jealousy.
When <unk> is in its chest agony of soon listening to the doors of the doors and <unk> to the <unk> of your lover -- then it defends those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different to the interpretation of an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "These are scientific research with real value <unk>
<unk> is trying to prove that the <unk> look <unk> and they make us seem <unk> but in their <unk> they're search for knowledge, search for truth -- a really painful truth -- in fact, what it was to <unk> <unk> the more painful the truth.
The pain, the <unk> the <unk> These were the pathways in the wisdom of <unk>
He says, "A woman who needs us is that it makes us suffer, it causes us to have a lot more profound and vital feelings than a wise man who can be <unk>
It's telling us that we're going to look for women.
No. I think it's trying to say that <unk> reveal ourselves.
And there's some other emotion that makes us <unk> in this particular way.
Is there any other emotion of us, our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Any other emotion that teaches us to look at <unk>
Freud would write about this later.
One day, Freud was visited by a very <unk> young man who was being used with the idea that his wife would <unk>
And Freud said that there was something strange in that man, who didn't know what your wife's did.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that did his wife, without realizing it, <unk> behaviors.
<unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> with a man?
Freud said that man was becoming the unconscious <unk> of his wife.
<unk> are really good at this.
The novels really describe very well how <unk> makes us look at intensity but not accurately.
In fact, the more intensely we are, we are, we are more <unk>
And for this reason, I think, the <unk> lead us to make violent acts of violent acts of <unk>
<unk> drive us to behave in totally <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about me in the age of eight years, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard on the news.
A woman from Michigan from 52 years of age was captured by having created a false account on Facebook since the one that was sent messages to itself, for one year.
For a year. It's a year.
She was trying to get her back to the new girlfriend of his former boyfriend, I have to say that when or this, I reacted with <unk>
Because, let's be realistic.
How huge even if you get creativity. Right?
It's like <unk>
Like a novel from Patricia <unk>
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character of American literature.
It's the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> books that try to deal with our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the realm of jealousy, the membrane the membrane that separates what it might be, can be <unk> at a second.
Let's take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes out of <unk> or want what you have to get to the <unk> and to <unk> what you ever get, and it's under the floor. <unk> in your name, takes your rings, your cow accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route of Tom <unk>
I can't give you <unk> all over the world, as long as I wanted to.
It's a pity, because we live in times of envy.
We live in times of jealousy.
I mean, we're good citizens of social media, where the currency is <unk> right?
<unk> show us the <unk> I'm not safe.
So we're going to do what the characters are always doing when they're not sure, when they're at a mystery.
Let's go to the <unk> of Baker Street and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> they think about <unk> <unk> in Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I've always got a <unk> <unk> <unk> the head face of <unk> <unk> <unk> that needs <unk> <unk> needs the genius of <unk> but it bothers him.
Oh, I sounds so <unk>
<unk> it needs their help, but it was <unk> and <unk> with <unk> in each of the puzzles.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and eventually in "The <unk> of the Six <unk> once you <unk> <unk> to all of the <unk> <unk> it goes back to <unk> and he says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
Are we proud of <unk>
And he says there is no person in <unk> <unk> who doesn't want to <unk> your hand.
It's one of the very few times we see <unk> <unk> in history. It looks like this very emotional. That scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to treat them as a geometry problem without emotion.
You know, in a minute <unk> it's the opposite side of <unk>
For the next minute they're the same side.
All of a sudden, <unk> is allowed to admire that idea of being the <unk>
Could it even be so simple?
What if <unk> are really a matter of geometry just a question of where we allow us to be in relation to another?
Well, maybe we don't have to <unk> the excellence of the other.
We can relate to it.
But I like <unk> plans.
So as long as we expect that happens, we remember that we have the fiction for <unk>
<unk> fiction -- jealousy.
<unk> used <unk> invites them to the table.
And look at what <unk> sweet <unk> the terrifying one, Tom <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>
We're in great company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
The 21 of July 1969, Buzz Aldrin jumped out of the module on Apollo 11 and landed on the Sargasso Sea.
Armstrong and Aldrin were alone, but his presence in the surface of gray -- it was the culmination of a collective collective process.
The Apollo program was the largest mobilization.
To get to the moon -- NASA spent about 180 billion dollars today, or four percent of the federal budget.
Apollo gave work to about 400,000 people and asked about 20,000 businesses, universities and government agencies.
People were dead, including <unk> <unk>
But before the program Apollo program <unk> 24 men traveled to the moon.
<unk> walked on her surface, of which Aldrin Aldrin had to leave after Armstrong last year, is now the most <unk>
So why would you <unk>
They didn't get a lot of <unk> <unk> pounds of old rocks, and something that 24 <unk> later, a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> The cynical answer is that it was because President Kennedy wanted to demonstrate to the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the words of Kennedy at the University of Rice in <unk> gives us a better idea.
John F. <unk> Some people ask why the <unk>
Why do you turn it into our goal?
And you could also ask, why can you scale the most <unk> mountain.
35 years ago, why do you fly on the <unk>
Why is a Rice <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're hard.
Jason <unk> For the <unk> <unk> was not just a victory of the West about this in the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger emotion was the <unk> of the powers of technology.
They were because it was something great to be able to do it.
The landing on the moon occurred in a context of a long list of intangible technology.
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the plane, penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, it was <unk> the <unk> and they eliminated smallpox.
Technology seemed to own what Alvin <unk> in 1970 called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a candle ship, but in 1969, the crew crew was <unk> 10 miles / <unk>
Since 1970, no human being turned to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than <unk> 10, and the joyful optimism about the power of technology has been <unk> to see that problems we imagine that technology would solve as going to Mars, create a clean energy, cure cancer, or feed the world population -- they seem to have a result of it.
I remember watching <unk> 17.
I was five years old, and my mother told me that I didn't go to the <unk> tube of the rocket leave the rocket Saturn <unk>
I knew that this would be the last mission -- but I was completely sure that I would get to see colonies on Mars.
So it happened to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We heard it all the time.
We've heard this for the last two days here, at TED.
It seems like the technologists as if the technologists would have found us -- and they were enriched with trivial toys, things like <unk> applications and social media, or the algorithms that speed up <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've expanded and enriched our lives.
But we don't know the big problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's a <unk> explanation in Silicon Valley, that <unk> who have created less ambitious companies that were <unk> from the years to be <unk> quote, Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are the guilty, in concrete, the incentives that venture capitalists offer entrepreneurs to offer entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk of risk caused the creation of ideas to create the creation of ideas by funding -- or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
<unk> mostly what's wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when the venture capitalists were at the top of the high point without worrying about the risk, they preferred small investment -- which they could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always had problems to invest in technologies like energy, which need a massive capital and development of development is in the long term, not have invested in the development of technologies intended to solve big problems because they don't have a immediate commercial value.
No, the reasons we cannot solve the big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes, we chose to solve big problems.
Could we go to Mars if you were <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But to go to Mars it would require a political decision that was popular and that will never happen.
We're not going to Mars because everyone thinks there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve the big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the world's energy consumption comes from energy sources like solar and wind and <unk> Less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want the alternative energy sources that can compete at the price.
Now, the technologists, of entrepreneurs and economists are according to what policies and international treaties -- the development of an enhanced energy -- <unk> a significant increase in research and development and some kind of price of the price of coal.
But there is no hope in the political climate that we're going to see an energy policy of America or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes the big problems that seemed to look like technology, turn it out.
We know from the time that famines are a result of failure on the <unk>
But 30 years of research have taught us that famines are political crisis that affect the distribution of food.
Technology can better improve things like harvest or systems for the storage and food route, but there will be famines while there were bad governments.
Finally, big problems sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem really.
The president Nixon declared war to cancer in 1971, but we soon discovered that there are many kinds of cancer, some terribly resistant to the treatment, and only in the last 10 years, seem to be found found effective and effective and viable.
The hard problems are hard.
It's not true that we couldn't solve problems with technology.
We can and we need -- but these four elements have been <unk> the political leaders and the population must want to be able to solve the problem, the institutions must support <unk> must be really about a <unk> problem, and we must understand it.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the capacity of technology to solve big problems, it serves for those <unk>
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There is no <unk> competition like in the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy that <unk> the difficult and dangerous, and there's no popular science mythology like <unk> the solar system.
In general, going to the moon turned out to be simple.
I was just three days.
And actually, I was not even <unk> any problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be harder to get.
God knows we're not missing the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start with the <unk> ideas that are about trust.
They're so common that they've become <unk> of our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a <unk> there's been a great decrease of trust, it's a very general belief.
The second is a goal: we should have more trust.
And the third is a <unk> we should get the trust.
I think <unk> the target and the task has been <unk>
What I'm going to try to tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a target and a task, which I think gives you a more clear idea about the subject.
First of all, why do people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
And I turn to think that there may be <unk> in some activities or institutions and that could have gone up on others.
I don't have it.
But I can turn to design polls and opinion polls are supposed to be the source of the belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at opinion polls over time, there's no evidence of it.
I mean, the people who were <unk> about 20 years ago, mostly journalists and politicians, still <unk> the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago, they are still quite <unk> by nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly half the way.
But this is this evidence enough?
What the record opinion polls are, of course, opinion.
What else can you <unk>
What you're looking at is the <unk> attitudes that people manifests itself when they get certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if someone asked you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the teachers of <unk>
I'm probably going to be able to ask, "What do you say?
And that would be a very strong answer.
And you could say, when you've answered your question, "Well, I trust some, but in other <unk>
Which is very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to place the confidence <unk>
We don't assume that the level of trust we're going to feel for a kind of <unk> officer or a person -- it's going to be uniform in all of those.
I could, for example, I have to say I trust a certain elementary teacher that I know to give the class, but in any way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it was not a good <unk>
I could trust my friend more <unk> to keep a conversation, but no, maybe to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we've got those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we stop all that knowledge when we think about trust as a more <unk>
I think these surveys are very bad tools to measure the true level of real trust, because they're trying to embrace the good inherent judgment to the fact that you trust something or somebody.
Secondly, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think it's a stupid.
It's not that the goal that I would do.
I was afraid to have more confidence in what is <unk> but not what it is.
Ultimately, I'm <unk> I don't trust what's not reliable.
And I think that those people who would take their savings with the very <unk> called Mr. <unk> who then disappeared with them, I think of them, and I think, well, they were too <unk>
Having more trust is not a smart goal in this life.
<unk> <unk> or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right target.
Once you say, yeah, yeah, yeah, OK, that means that what matters in the first place is not trust, but trustworthiness.
So it's about making a judgment about how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think that to be able to make a judgment, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we found that one person is <unk> in the raw materials, and it's responsible for and honest, then we'll have a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to be worthy of trust.
But if the other hand, they're not responsible for the other hand, we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest, but they didn't get a letter to the mail to the mail -- because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that you can do certain things, but I see that I would take your own <unk>
And I'm glad to say that I think I don't have a lot of friends that are <unk> and responsible but extremely <unk>
If this is that, I still haven't been <unk>
But that's what we're looking at today before trust.
<unk> is the answer.
The top is what we need to do?
And of course, it's hard.
Over the last few decades, we tried to build systems of accountability for all sorts of institutions, professionals, officials and others, that made us easier to judge their trustworthiness.
A lot of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember once I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you'll see the problem is that it takes more time to make the <unk> <unk> I will think of <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and it turns out that the system of accountability that is destined to ensure that <unk> <unk> is actually doing the opposite.
What they do is they <unk> the work of the people who have to do hard tasks, like the <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> as we say.
I'm sure you all know similar examples.
You know, they would have all of that, by the target.
I think that the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if they were afraid of being worthy of being worthy of trust, and if you give them to people that we are reliable and if we stop determining whether other people, officials or political are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the judgment, the simple actions, the <unk> which doesn't do properly.
Third, the task.
They get the task to rebuild trust, puts things backwards.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild the trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can rebuild a little trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, together, trying to improve trust.
But trust, ultimately, it's defining because we give them a lot of other people.
You can't rebuild what other people have given you.
You have to give them the foundations of enough to be able to trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't <unk> all the people, all the time.
But you also have to be able to be <unk> that you're worthy of trust.
How do you do that?
That is every day, everywhere, and it makes the common people, the <unk> the institutions, very effectively.
I'll give you a simple example here.
The store where I buy my socks says I can do it without giving explanations.
I wear them and get my money, or you change the color that I want.
That's great. I trust them because they became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a big lesson in that.
If you come back vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of trust, and you have confidence in what you're saying.
So, in the end, I think that what we're pointing at, is not a very difficult thing to <unk>
What people trust is in the relationships, and in that framework, you can determine when and how the other person is worthy of trust.
Thank you.
From the early computers we have come up with us, by reducing the separation between us and the digital information, the separation between our material and the world of the screen where the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has gone <unk> increasingly and more and more, at a point that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of the glass of a tactile screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I ask myself, and if there was no <unk>
I started to imagine how to <unk>
So I first created this tool that goes into the digital space, so that when the strong <unk> against the transfers is the physical body to the pixel itself.
Designers can <unk> their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice with virtual organs under the screen.
So with this tool, the barriers.
But the two hands remain still out of the screen.
How can we get inside and interact with the digital information using the whole skill of your hands?
In the <unk> Science division of Microsoft, along with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a little space on the keyboard in a digital area of work.
They put up a transparent bombsight with the depth of depth to detect your fingers and face, now you can raise your hands of the keyboard, getting inside the 3D space, and grab pixels directly with your hands.
Like windows and files have a location in real space, <unk> is so easy to grab a book from a <unk>
You can flip through the book and point out lines or words with the virtual touch sensor that is below every floating screen.
The architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with hands.
In these examples, we are <unk> in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and make the digital information come into us?
<unk> many of us will have bought and created things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device <unk> or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we took this idea further, I thought, instead of just looking at pixels in the space, how we can make them physicists so that we can get <unk> and <unk>
How would that be a future like this?
At the MIT Media Lab, with my tutor Hiroshi Ishii, and my collaborator <unk> Post, we create this only physical pixel together.
This magnet, <unk> it behaves like a 3D pixel in the space, which means that the computer as the users can move the object anywhere inside this little three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was we <unk> gravity and control the movement through a combination of <unk> <unk> <unk> mechanical and <unk>
And by programming the object, the object, we released it from the constraints of time and space, which means that human movements can <unk> and will go back to reproduce and stay in the physical world.
You can teach them physically <unk> and the famous <unk> of Michael Jordan, you can reproduce it as a physical reality.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, and the physics, and unlike <unk> or textbooks, this is a real and palpable experience that you can touch and feel.
But what's most fascinating is that changing the physical part of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our everyday physical activities.
As you see, digital information is not just going to show us something but to begin to act on us as part of the physical world that surrounds us without we have to take care of our world.
So we started the talk today talking about a barrier, but if you <unk> that barrier, the only limit that is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was pleased to become <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the 1960s.
When I was in first grade, the government wanted to take a school for athletes with all the payments.
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After surviving the Islamic Revolution -- they create firmly that there was only a immediate way to the <unk> a safe job, and <unk>
No matter whether I work or not.
But my dream was to be an American opera singer but my dream.
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer must start <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
I even wrote to the director of the school and a radio text program.
But any adult would tell you the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
I just got my friends, but they were children, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15, I knew it was too much too much as a train.
My dream will never be <unk>
They would argue that during the rest of my life a second class happiness was the only thing that you might aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I resolved to look for another <unk>
No one around me wanted to <unk> OK.
I went to the books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I came to America in 1995, and what were the first books to do here?
Those who were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> is about life <unk>
And it's not a strong crime.
The Bible is interesting.
That's one issue for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> to your father and your mother."
<unk> I said. "It is so different, and so much better than <unk>
So it became my tool to get out of this <unk> <unk> and to reset the relationship with my parents.
I meet with a new culture also led to my <unk> <unk>
<unk> lots of perspectives.
For example, the beginning of this map seemed to me to be outside because this is what students in China learn.
I'd never occurred, that China had to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
<unk> reading is not something new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There are all of the research fields like comparative comparative and literature literature.
<unk> and <unk> offers the academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought, if the comparative reading work worked for researching, why not do it in life <unk>
So I started reading books.
They can be <unk> <unk> of Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> from David <unk> who were involved in a same <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For <unk> <unk> are economic and political and <unk>
For Buddha, they're all <unk> lust, fear and <unk>
If you know other language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
<unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> Alan <unk> instead of <unk> in translation, found that you can win a lot of it.
For example, it's through the translation that I realized that <unk> in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> <unk> mother."
The books opened up a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know I'm not going to feel like <unk>
Having a <unk> dream is really not compared to what many others have <unk>
I've come to believe that realization is not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect to the place that the dreams, where the dreams comes from, where the passion, where happiness.
Until a <unk> dream can do that for you.
And it's because of the books, which I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clarity, most of the time.
So the books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first client in <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology in Berkeley.
She was a woman in 26 years called <unk>
Alex came into the first session using jeans and a freshman in the <unk> ran on the couch of my office pulled off the shoes and told me he wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My classmates had a <unk> like the first client.
And I got a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the stories of <unk> that Alex brought the <unk> became easy to just move my head while you get the solution.
"The 30 is the new <unk> saying, Alex, and so I saw she was right.
You start to work after that, you start to work later, she has children later, to death later.
To fear like Alex and I had time to be <unk>
But shortly afterwards, my <unk> pushed me to press Alex who talk about his life <unk>
I was shocked.
I said, "Yes, it's coming out with guys under his category, <unk> with a <unk> <unk> but it's not like it was to marry him."
And then my <unk> he said, "No, no, but maybe you get married with the next.
In addition, the best time to work in the marriage of Alex is before they were <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized the <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel their head after what they get, but this didn't make them <unk> in Alex to be a pause in their development.
This made the <unk> of Alex were the perfect moment and we were <unk>
And so I realized that this kind of benign <unk> was a real problem and had real consequences, not only for Alex and his loving life, but for careers, families and future <unk>
There's 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think nobody comes in age without going to happen before the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the joy of here.
Oh, Yes! They're amazing.
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> you take the dream -- a <unk> I want to see. It's right. <unk> all the <unk> matter.
This is not just my opinion. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will be about 35 years.
This means that eight of every 10 decisions and experiences and <unk> moments that give your life will have happened to be 30 and <unk>
People in more than 40, you can't keep panic.
This audience is going to be good, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career have an exponential impact on the amount of money that we have.
We know more than half of Americans are married, they live or they're going out with their future partner at 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up its second and last stage of growth in their <unk> and it <unk> for <unk> which means that if there is something that you want to change from themselves, now is the moment to change it.
We know that the self changes more times during their <unk> than at any other time of life, and we know that the female fertility comes to its top to the 28, and things become complicated to the <unk>
<unk> are the moment to get them on their body and their options.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are crucial for language and attachment in the brain.
It's a moment in which your everyday life and common life has an impact on the person who was <unk>
But what we don't hear is that there's something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in the adult development.
But this is not what the men are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the middle of the time.
The researchers call the <unk> a extended teenager, a <unk>
<unk> journalists <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines the <unk>
Leonard <unk> said that to achieve big things, you need a plan and not enough time.
It's not true?
What do you think happens when they give a <unk> in your head and say, you have another 10 years to start your <unk>
There's nothing.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and his ambition and it doesn't happen absolutely nothing.
And then every day, intelligent clever day, like you or your children and daughters come to my office and say something like this: "I know my boyfriend is not good for me, but this relationship is not true. I'm just killing the time."
Or they say, "All of them say that while I start a race before the '30s, all being right."
But then it starts going to sound like this: "My <unk> are <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had better curriculum.
And then it starts going sound like this: "My quotes during the <unk> were like the game of chairs.
They were all running and <unk> but then at some point around the '30s, turned the music and everyone started to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only one who would stop, and I sometimes think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair.
Where are the <unk>
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little bit extreme, but they don't get <unk> the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for <unk> there's a huge amount of pressure to the 30 and so many of you will start a career, to choose a city, pick a partner, and have two or three children in a much more short time period in a long time.
Many of these things are not <unk> and there are research that start to show, which is a lot harder and stressful <unk> to do everything from once to <unk>
The middle age crisis is not about buying red sports cars.
It's about realizing that you can't have the career you want now.
Realizing you can't have the son you want now, or you can't give a brother to your son.
A lot of <unk> and <unk> you see themselves, and I was sitting in the room, and they talk about your <unk> "What was I doing? What was you thinking?"
I want to change what the ads are doing and thinking.
Here's a story about how it might be.
It's a story about a woman named <unk>
By 25, Emma came to my office because it was, in his own words, having a crisis of identity.
He said I'd like to work in art or in entertainment, but you still couldn't decide, so that I spent the last few years working as a <unk>
As it was cheaper, she lived with a boyfriend, who showed more <unk> than ambition.
And despite living some very difficult <unk> his previous life had been even more difficult.
They were often getting together in our <unk> but then she was up to say, "You don't choose your family, but you can choose your friends."
Well, one day she came up with her head on his legs and cried for almost every hour.
I had just bought a new book for <unk> and I had spent all the morning I went on with his many <unk> but then he stayed looking at the empty space that follows after the words <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk>
I was about to the <unk> when he saw me and he said, "Who is going to be for me if I have a car accident.
Who is going to take care of if I give me <unk>
At that time, I took a lot of work to resist and I didn't mean <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> that really was <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as to sit while the decade of Emma went on.
So for the next few weeks and months, I told Emma three things that all <unk> man or female, deserves to know.
First of all, I said to Emma that it was <unk> from that identity crisis and <unk> of identity.
For identity, I mean doing something that add value to your person.
Doing something that is a investment in what they want to be next.
I didn't know the future of <unk> and nobody knows the future of work, but I do know this: capital capital generates identity.
So now it's time for that work on the other side of the country, from that company that they want to try it.
I'm not <unk> exploration -- I'm <unk> the exploration that I should not count, by the way, that by the way, it's not <unk>
It's <unk>
I told him to try to explore jobs and make it count.
Second, I said to Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to get you to the airport, but the ads that get together with friends with their minds are limited to the same as they know who you know what you know, how they think about, how they talk, and where do they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person who is going to get out almost always comes from the outside of your nearest circle nearby.
The new things come from what they're called weak links from friends of their friends.
Yes, half of the boxes, have a bad job or they don't have work.
But the other half of all, and the weak links are the way of <unk> to this group.
Half the <unk> jobs would never be <unk> then knowing the head of your neighbor is the way you get a job not published.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how the information is happening.
For the last thing, but not least, she thinks you don't pick your family, but I know her friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as he was growing up, Emma will soon take her family when they have a partner and form her own family.
I said to Emma that time to choose his family had come.
Maybe you think that 30 is better age to sit my head than 20 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But choosing the person that you live now, or you're going to tell you now when you're all on Facebook start to walk towards <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you have, and that involves being so <unk> in love as you're at work.
<unk> your family has to be a conscious choice of who and what you want instead of just to make it work or kill a time with anyone who will be <unk>
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found the roommate of a cousin who was working at an art museum in another state.
This weak link helped me get a job there.
That work of work gave her a reason to leave the boyfriend, with it that he alive.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special of events in museums.
This married man who chose <unk>
<unk> his new career, he loves his new family, and I send a letter that said, "Now the space of contacts contacts are not good enough.
The story of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love about working with <unk>
It's very easy to help them.
<unk> are like airplanes that come out from Los Angeles, who go somewhere in the West.
Just before the <unk> a light fits in your trajectory makes the difference between land in Alaska or <unk>
In the same way, at the age of 21 or 25 and even the <unk> a good conversation, a good TED Talk can have huge effects in the next few years or even the next generation.
Here's my idea worth spreading to all of the <unk>
It's as simple as what I learned to say to <unk>
This is what I now have the privilege to tell <unk> like Emma every day: <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get a computer capital capital -- use your weak links to your family.
They don't know what they didn't know or what they didn't do.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very <unk> job management for a job that was even more <unk> the <unk>
I was to teach them mathematics to <unk> students in New York City.
And as any teacher, I made tests and tests.
I give you assignments.
When I went back, I was going to save grades.
What I called the attention was that <unk> was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of those who had a better performance had no I.Q. I.Q. scores <unk>
Some of my smartest children were not going so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of thing that you need to learn in math in seventh grade, safe, are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was very convinced that every one of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and for time enough.
After several years later, I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know about how to measure a better way.
It's the <unk> but what if you're successful in school and life depends on a lot more than the ability to learn in very fast and easy?
So I left the classrooms and I went to college to become <unk>
I started studying children and adults in all kinds of <unk> <unk> and in every study, my question was, who has success here and why?
My research team and I went to the Academy of <unk> West <unk>
We're trying to predict what to <unk> <unk> in military training.
We went to the National <unk> National <unk> and we tried to predict what children are going to do as far as it was possible in competition.
We studied teachers who are working on really difficult neighborhoods, and we can see what teachers are still teaching for the end of the school year and of <unk> who will be the most effective thing to improve the outcomes of their <unk>
We partnered with private businesses, asking me what of these marketers are going to keep their <unk>
And who is going to make more money?
In all these very different contexts arose -- a feature as a significant <unk> of success.
And it wasn't the social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, the physical health, and it wasn't <unk>
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and <unk> to achieve very long-term goals.
<unk> has to have resistance.
The determination is clinging to his future, day after day, not only for the month, but for years and working hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live life as if it was a <unk> not a <unk>
A few years ago, I started studying determination in public school schools.
I asked thousands of high school students that did my <unk> and then waited for over a year to see those who are <unk>
It turns out that children with more determination had been significantly higher likely to be able to get them into every feature that I could measure, things like family income, the results of the family income, even the security results that they felt when they were in school.
So it's not only in West Point or in the National <unk> of <unk> where <unk> is also in school, especially for children at risk of <unk>
For me, the most shocking thing about determination is the little bit that we know how little science is about it.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How is the determination in children?
What do I have to do to teach kids a solid job work?
How do we keep them motivated for the long <unk>
The more honest answer is, I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't give them <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are a lot of talented individuals who simply don't go ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, which is commonly related to it or it's even related to the grain of talent.
So far, the best idea I've heard about developing determination is something called <unk> <unk>
This is an idea that was developed at Stanford University by Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, it can change with the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and they learn about the brain and how it changes and growing in response to the challenge, are much more likely to <unk> when they were <unk> because they don't think that failure is a permanent condition.
So the mindset of growth is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where I finish my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have to go forward.
We need to take our best ideas, our strongest intuitions and we need to <unk>
We need to measure if they've been successful and we need to be willing to fail, to <unk> to start everything back with the ultimate lessons.
In other words, we need to be certain about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan like the daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> memories is my mother <unk> the way and the shape of the Chinese characters.
Since that moment, I was fascinated by this incredible language.
But for a foreigner. It seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall
In the last few years, I've been wondering if I can break down this <unk> so that he wants to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language can do it.
I started thinking about how a new method and quickly learning Chinese could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw every single strokes of every character of every character on the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Because we only have five minutes, it's better than let's do it in a faster and simple way.
A Chinese heroes, <unk> 20,000 characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic literacy stuff.
The first 200 will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature -- enough to read <unk> traffic <unk> to understand the basic idea of the Web or the newspapers.
Today I will start with eight to show you how the method.
Are you ready?
Open your mouth as much as you might be able to be <unk>
They get a mouth.
This is a person who is going to give a walk.
<unk>
If the way of fire is a person with arms on both sides, as if I was shouting <unk> I am <unk> -- this symbol is actually <unk> in the way called, but I like to believe it is the other way.
This is a tree.
tree tree tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a couple of <unk> <unk> in the old West.
I call <unk> to these eight characters.
They are building blocks so they believe many more characters.
One person.
If someone walks back, that's <unk>
As the old said, two are a company, three are <unk>
If a person stretches your arms, this person is saying <unk> so big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a <unk> such as <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree tree together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we have the forest.
Put a table under the tree, we have the <unk>
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk> --  <unk> from remember, because a speaker tree is quite an idiot.
Remember the fire?
Two together, it gets very hot.
Three -- that's a lot of fire.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the moon together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and a night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
One door. You put a table inside the door, it's the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, ask questions.
<unk> there is somebody at home?
This person is coming out of a door, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three women together, they're <unk>
So we've gone for almost 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight of radical will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters build other 32.
So with every little effort, it will be able to learn a couple hundred characters, which is the same thing as you learn a Chinese Chinese.
So after knowing the characters, we started creating sentences.
For example, the mountain and fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the land of the sun.
This is a sun placed in the beginning because Japan is east of China.
So an sun next to the beginning, we create Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left are two stacked together, and one on the other.
In the ancient China, that meant in exile, because the Chinese <unk> <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the exile has become out.
A mouth that tells you to go out is a <unk>
This is a slide to remind me that I have to stop talking and talk to the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be my dad is the films I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the Holocaust magician together.
The film took their imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave a good excuse to use a bright dress and bring a magic wand and take a magic wand to it.
But when you see that movie so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live and raising our children in a kind of an industrial complex image of a computer fantasy show.
However, the Holocaust magician, was an event in itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend really took spent 40 years later with, interestingly enough, another movie whose <unk> a metal <unk> and a <unk> kid who was born as a <unk>
Do you know what I'm talking about?
There's a big difference between these two films, there's a couple of great differences between the <unk> of Oz and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there are very little violence in <unk> <unk>
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like <unk>
But I think if the Holocaust magician would do today, the magician, would say, <unk> you're the salvation of Oz as a self-fulfilling prophecy.
<unk> magical shoes to defeat the rest of the <unk> the evil <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another unique thing about the Holocaust magician, is that the most educated and wise characters are women.
I started to notice this when I asked "Star <unk> to my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that point, I also had a child.
Just three years.
It wasn't invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of oversight had <unk>  So he was so slid in the room and he was impressed as a leg with her <unk> behind, and I don't think he understood what was happening, but I was going to understand everything.
I wonder what to <unk>
They would be themes of value, <unk> and <unk>
I should feel that Luke feel an army to <unk> the government?
<unk> this with the magician <unk>
How do you win Dorothy his movie?
And they're doing good <unk> with all and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my kids to grow up with it, OK?
Why is there so much of the capital force, the force in the movies for our children, and so little on the road of <unk>
There's a lot of literature about the impact of the movies of male violence in the girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this encouragement.
I know this experience that the princess <unk> doesn't give me the proper framework that I would have served to navigate the world of the adults who is <unk>  I think at the time of the first election, I really expected the people to begin to appear because it's the end of the movie, right?
My search is done, I have a girlfriend.
Why are you standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
The movies are focused on <unk> and getting their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like a child, you have to be a dumb animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk>
There are a lot of exceptions, and I want to defend from Disney to any of you.
But they send a message to kids, although they kids, they are not really their target audience.
They do a phenomenal job by teaching girls how to defend themselves against the <unk> but they don't necessarily show the kids how to defend their <unk>
There is no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our children, as real and beautiful as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being war movies.
Of course, the most successful theme of all times continues to be appearing by classic by classic each one of them about the adventure of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and his son, or two men who raised a child.
Until many of you are thinking, this year, he finally came out.
I recommend all of you. It's already available in stores.
Remember what the criticism said when he came out.
I can't believe that Pixar has done a movie of a <unk>
Is it very good. Don't let them be <unk>
Well, almost none of these films is the proof of <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It's still not <unk> and already <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book comic -- and in the <unk> I recorded a conversation that had had a friend of mine about the assessment of the movies that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that must be <unk> In the movie, there's more than a female character who has lines?
So you have to fulfill the <unk>
These women talk to each other at some point in the movie?
Your conversations are about something more besides the guy than you like.  Right? Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and talk about things with each other.
<unk> I've seen it, and yet I really rarely see it in the movie that we know and love.
In fact, this week, I went to see a very good quality movie.
Right? <unk> of <unk> success of <unk> a sense of consensus about what a Hollywood Hollywood movie.
<unk> doesn't happen to <unk>
And I don't think that <unk> because a lot of the movie, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the film happens in a embassy where men and women are hidden during the crisis of <unk>
We have many scenes from men who have profound and painful conversations in this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the actors to take a look at the door and say, <unk> to bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's go through the numbers.
In 2011, of the 100 most popular movies, how many of them believe that they have protagonists <unk>
<unk> isn't wrong.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women we've chosen recently for Congress, then it's fine.
But there is a larger number that this is going to take you this room.
Last year, The New York Times ran a study that the government had done.
This is what he said.
In the United States, one in five women says it's been sexually assaulted once in his life.
I don't think it's the fault of mass entertainment.
I don't think the films for children have something to do with that.
I also don't think that music videos or pornography are closely <unk> but something is wrong, and when I listen to that statistics, one of the things I think is that there's a great amount of sexual <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are those <unk>
What do you not get to <unk>
They are <unk> the story of a male hero is defeat the <unk> with violence, and then collect the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we found this world and this very alarming statistic and we want to <unk>
We have tools to our disposal as a <unk> <unk> and we hope that we will say, <unk> <unk> is going to <unk> if, at the same time, active or <unk> we are educating our children to keep their power <unk>
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean primarily to the parents.
I think we have to show our children a new definition of <unk>
The definition of box, it's radically changing.
You've read about how the new economy is changing the role that we care about home and <unk>
Everything is changing.
When I asked my daughter, what was his favorite page of Star Trek <unk> You know what you would do?"
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What do you have in common these two?
Maybe it's not just the brilliant dress.
I think they are experts.
I think these are the two people in those films that you know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to help them to reach their potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want fewer stories in which I tell my <unk> <unk> and fight only and more stories where her work looked like to join a team, maybe a team led by women, helping other people better and better people, like the magician <unk>
Thank you.
As a girl, I lived in Maine and one of the things that I loved it was looking at sea biscuits on the shores of Maine because my parents told me that that would give me lucky.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered in sand and it's hard to see them.
However, with the time, I was afraid of <unk>
I started to see shapes and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in a love for the past and the <unk>
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized that I saw my own eyes wasn't enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up to one of nearly 1.3 miles of length and the <unk>
And my sea biscuits had grown up to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew I had to do it differently.
So I want to show you an example of how different we see by using the <unk>
This is a place located on the eastern delta in Egypt called <unk>
And the thing, it seems to be brown, but when we use the infrared and we process it using <unk> and suddenly it looks like pink <unk>
What you're seeing are the real chemical changes of the landscape of building materials and the activities of the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we used satellite data to find a old city, a old city called <unk> missing for thousands of years.
<unk> was the ancient capital capital for over 400 years in a period of time called the Middle Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place lies in <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle Empire there was this great renaissance of the ancient art <unk> architecture and religion.
<unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that <unk> <unk> within the red circles here, but somewhere within this huge <unk> <unk>
This area is massive, it's about <unk> per mile.
Before, the Nile <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, they moved to this and covered the entire city.
So how do you find a city of a <unk> <unk>
And I'll try and find out at random would be the equivalent of a needle in a <unk> with the eyes of <unk> and using baseball gloves on.
So we use NASA data to make a map of place, with very subtle changes.
We were able to see where the <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interestingly, this slightly high area that looks inside the circle here, that we think it might be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with Egyptian scientists doing <unk> they can see it here.
When I say <unk> this is how you take it in ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we look for layers of human desire.
Five feet down, underneath a thick layer of principle, we found a dense layer of objects from ceramics.
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five feet down, we have a layer of occupation, many hundreds of years that date out of the Middle Empire exactly the same period that we think is <unk>
We also found <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> which shows that there was a <unk> shop.
This might seem to seem that it's not a lot, but when we think about the most common stones used on the jewelry jewelry -- these are the stones that are <unk>
So, we have a dense layer of occupation that goes back from the Middle Empire in this place.
We also have evidence of an elite jewelry shop, which shows that what I've been there, was a very important city.
We still didn't find any <unk> here, but it <unk> the place in a future close to <unk>
And more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they can also make great discoveries.
I want to finish with my favorite quote from the Middle Roman quote from the Middle Empire -- it was probably written in <unk> 4,000 years ago:
Let me share knowledge is the biggest of all <unk>
There's nothing like that on the ground.
So according to TED it was not founded in 1984 <unk> C.
Do ideas actually start in 1984 BC.
It certainly puts the pursuit of <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside the door of <unk> home.
I'd like to pay attention to the color of the door, the material that you're made.
Now we <unk> a group of <unk> <unk>
They're competing for a <unk> race and they're in the direction of their <unk>
I need to look at this <unk>
They're <unk> strong, they're <unk> they're <unk>
They collide with the door of their home.
There are bicycles flying all over the parts, wheels on the side of the wheels that end up in <unk> places -- <unk> the threshold threshold.
<unk> the hall, or what there is to the other side of the door, and look at the quality of light. The light is shining on the <unk> of the <unk>
It's waving with your hand.
From his chair, on a brown horse.
It's a horse that speaks speech.
You can feel your blue <unk> by being tickle on your nose.
You can smell the <unk> and you think it's about to get into the mouth.
They went through a side and enter their living room.
Already in the room, and making a lot of their imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
He's with little clothes, dancing on her <unk> <unk> singing <unk> One More <unk>
Now let's go to the kitchen.
The ground has covered with a path of yellow building and from the oven, come to you <unk> the Man of <unk> the <unk> and the Len was <unk> of <unk> <unk> of the hands, jumping up to you.
Okay, open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a particular competition that takes place every spring in New York City.
It's called the <unk> of <unk>
I was going to cover this event a few years ago as a <unk> journalist, I guess, that this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few of different ages and different habits of hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers, you see them just once.
<unk> names of tens of strangers.
We were giving entire poems in just minutes.
<unk> to see who he could memorize the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was thinking, "This is <unk>
These people must be phenomena of nature.
And I started talking with some of the competitors.
This is a man named Ed <unk> who had come from England and has one of the best memories <unk>
I said, <unk> when you realized you were a <unk>
Ed replied, I'm not a wise.
I actually have average memory.
Everyone involved in this competition say they have normal memory.
"We have been trained to perform these miracle acts of memory using some ancient techniques. invented two years ago in Greece, the same techniques that used <unk> to memorize their narratives -- and that academics <unk> used to memorize books.
And my reaction was: "How do I have no heard of this <unk>
We were standing outside the room of competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful and brilliant English -- although a little bit <unk> said, <unk> you're an American journalist.
Do you know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I'd like to teach Britney <unk> how to memorize the order in a deck of cards in a live television on national TV.
That would prove to the world that anyone can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
I mean, you have to start by something <unk>
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
And I ended up spending most of the next year not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why it doesn't work and what their potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man named <unk>
He's <unk> very probably with the worst memory in the world.
Her memory was so bad that I didn't even remember that he had a <unk> problem, it's amazing.
Someone incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allows us to see how much our memory makes us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> In he based on the paper of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk>
We spent a afternoon in the public library of Salt Lake City, <unk> <unk> was <unk>
And when I came back, it was a lot of treaties on the memory of written something more than 2,000 years ago in Latin, in <unk> and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having <unk> and disciplined memory was not a thing as rare as you can look like today.
A long time ago, people invest in their memory, in providing their minds.
These techniques have made possible our modern world, but they also have changed us.
We have changed the <unk> and I would say that they have changed a lot of a <unk>
As we almost don't have any need to remember, sometimes we have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you still find people passionate about this idea of a disciplined memory, disciplined and <unk> is this kind of competition of memory.
It's not really that <unk> there are <unk> like this in the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people are.
A few years ago, a group of researchers from University College invited a group of memory champions in the lab.
They wanted to know that it has brains in some way, structural structural or <unk> different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Are they more intelligent than the <unk>
They gave them a cognitive test, and the answer was actually not.
There was yet a really interesting and significant difference between the brains of memory champions and the subjects of control with the <unk>
When they put them in a pop-up MRI machine, they <unk> your brains as they <unk> numbers, faces and forms of <unk> they found that in memory champions are <unk> parts of the brain, different to others.
They were able to <unk> or seemed <unk> a part of the brain that involves spatial memory and navigation.
Why? There's something we can learn from this?
The tournament <unk> <unk> is running as an armed career, where each year appears to someone with a new way of remembering more things, more quickly, and then the rest of competitors must get a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times a memory player.
In your desk, in front of him, there are 36 <unk> of <unk> <unk> that he is about to try to memorize in an hour, using a technique that he invented and only he <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of <unk> digits <unk>
<unk>
And while there is a huge amount of ways to remember things in these competence, absolutely all the techniques used by the end of the way the psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It illustrates with a elegant paradox known as the American <unk> paradox -- he says this: I mean two people who remember the same word, I tell you, <unk> -- there's a man named <unk>
That's your <unk>
And then I ask you, "You know, there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I come back later and I ask them, I wonder that word I told you about a <unk>
<unk> what do you do?"
The person who told you that his name is Baker is unlikely to remember the same word that the person who said that his work is <unk>
The same word, different capacity of <unk> that is weird.
What happens here?
Well, the name Baker, actually means nothing for you. It doesn't have any relationship.
With all the other memories they dance for their head.
But the word, <unk> we know <unk>
They wear <unk> <unk>
They have <unk> hands.
<unk> when they come back home to work.
Probably <unk> some <unk>
And when you go to that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some time later.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this dates from two years ago in the Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
The story says this: There was a poet called <unk> who attended a <unk>
They had been hired as entertainment, because before, if you wanted to give a very good party, he didn't take a <unk> <unk> to a <unk>
He stood up to me <unk> his poem from memory, and he <unk> and it was so soon he was, the classroom <unk> <unk>
<unk> everybody.
But not only killed everyone, but it shattered the bodies to <unk>
No one could say who was there, nobody could remember where they were sitting.
So they could not be able to <unk> the <unk>
A tragedy behind the other.
I was standing out there, only surviving a single survivor, in the middle of the rubble, closed eyes and realized that with the eyes of his mind, I could see where he had been sitting next to you.
I took the relatives of the <unk> hand, where they were their loved ones between the rubble.
So what you would find out at that moment is something that we all know more or less <unk> and it is that no matter if we are not good at remembering names or phone numbers or the word <unk> or the word <unk> of our colleagues, we have visual memory and exceptional stories.
If I would tell you that I would give me the first 10 words of the story that I just told you about <unk> it's very likely to be able to do it.
But I would bet if you asked them to tell you who was sitting on the horse and brown motor in your lobby, would be able to <unk>
The idea of the palazzo of memory is to create this building with the eyes of your mind and <unk> of images with the things that you want to remember.
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, to the first <unk> of memory, in <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say you were invited to the TED stage to give a talk and you want to make it from memory, the same way that I would have done it -- if they had been invited to <unk> 2,000 years ago.
What you could do is imagine that they're on the door of your house.
And to come up with some kind of absolutely ridiculous image and <unk> to help them remember that the first thing they want to mention is that absolute <unk>
And then you can imagine coming into your house, and see the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And that will remind you that you want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind you that funny anecdote that you want to count.
And then in the kitchen, and the fourth issue that they would talk about would be that strange journey that they did for a whole year, and they have some friends to help you remember it.
So this is like the speakers <unk> <unk> their narratives -- not by word, which is going to confuse it but typical by typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a <unk> of when people thought about <unk> and in the rhetoric with this sort of spatial terms.
The phrase <unk> first <unk> would be like the first place in his memory.
I saw that this was just fascinating, and I stood up with it.
I went to some of these memory <unk> and I had the idea of writing a big thing about this <unk> <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition.
And seriously, it's like looking at a lot of people sitting taking tests. I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when someone got off the front.
I'm a journalist, and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself in his place.
So I began to spend 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before sitting at the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an ancient school woman bought a market market.
And I found that this was fun <unk>
I would never expect it to do it.
It was fun, because it wasn't just about training the memory.
What is actually about doing is better more and more the ability to create and imagine these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of the mind.
I was hooked pretty much with this.
This is me, using my standard training team for memory competition.
It's a couple of <unk> and <unk> covered with tape leaving only two <unk> because the red distraction is the worst enemy of a memory competitor <unk>
I ended up coming back to the same contest that I had covered a year before. He had the idea that I could be able to put it into a kind of <unk> <unk> experiment.
I thought this could serve for good <unk> for all of my research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something that I didn't have to happen.
Of course it's nice to be able to memorize narratives and phone numbers, and you know, it's actually not the point.
These are just such a tricks.
Because they are based on very basic principles about how the brain works.
And you don't need to be able to build <unk> of memory or memorize them from <unk> to benefit from <unk> to benefit from a little bit of insights on how your mind works.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was a gift of <unk> but it's not the case.
The great memories are <unk>
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
And then we got to focus on when we focus deeply.
The palace of <unk> These memory techniques are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk>
They work because they make us <unk>
<unk> a kind of deep processing -- a kind of complete attention that most of you are not going to hang out there.
But the reality is that there's no shortcuts.
That's how things are <unk>
And if there is something that I want to leave you with today is what I mean -- the <unk> I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, I left me to me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How many of us are willing to lose what is our <unk> existence in <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to the human being in front of us, who is walking on our side, we will be so <unk> that we don't even tell us to process in <unk>
I learned from the first hand that there are incredible memory capacities in all of us.
But if you want to live a life -- you must be the kind of person that remembers remember.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
This is a complex issue, so we would just take a place -- just <unk> New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I am from a team, Jersey, I was six years old, and I lived there in my parents' house in a village called <unk> and this was my <unk>
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom that I shared with my sister.
And between my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony that gave the living room.
And there were all the time looking at the television television, so every time I was going from my room to the bathroom, and I saw me and every time I got married, and I would come back in a <unk> I all saw me.
And I was like this.
I was <unk> and I hated it.
And I hated that journey, I hated that <unk> I hated that room and that house.
That's architecture.
All right.
These feelings, those emotions that I felt, that is the power of architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics, and it's about those connections that are emotional <unk> that we feel in the places that we have.
And it's not surprising that we feel like this, because according to the Protection Agency --  Americans spend 90 percent of their time under the roof.
I mean, 90 percent of the time are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
The architecture determines us in ways we don't even realize it.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you would do, you think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know they think about it by based on a building built a half thousand years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> that uses architects to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
It's an emotional <unk> <unk> we've used this trick for a long, long time.
We use it 200 years ago to build <unk>
We use it in the 19th century to build art museum.
And in the 20th century in America, we use it to build houses.
See, these <unk> stable, in front of the sea, away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a lot of time and it's very complicated.
The people who are <unk> and governments are always afraid of innovation, and they prefer to use ways they know they're going to work.
So we met with buildings like this.
It's a beautiful <unk>
It's the Public Public Library that ended in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, it has a <unk> it has this neat thing -- columns -- red brick that leaves <unk> what <unk> tries to communicate with this <unk> children, the values values -- the story.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, the other side of the country, became another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital age.
It's a new kind of equipment for the city, a place to meet and read and share.
So how could it be that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, two buildings, both so-called libraries, are so different?
And the answer is that architecture works at the beginning of the <unk>
On one side is the <unk> the architects that constantly drive new technologies -- new new solutions for the forms of life.
We kind of take it back and we kind of push out so much of the people.
<unk> -- you know, you think we feel very good, but we're dead because we have no other option.
We need to go on the other side and connect with those symbols <unk>
So we do that, and we're all happy, but we feel like <unk> so we started to experience <unk> we make the pendulum back and over again. So we've done it in the last 300 years, and of course it is, in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago, I was in the '70s.
The architects were busy experimenting with the so-called <unk>
It has to do with the concrete.
You can guess.
<unk> small, <unk>
Something really really really is.
So we get to the '80s, and we start bringing those symbols.
Let's get the pendulum again in the other direction.
We take those ways we know that we like and <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we add bake and we use a new material.
They love it.
We don't give <unk>
We took <unk> <unk> and we made them in skyscrapers that can be <unk> <unk> made of glass.
The shapes were <unk> they won on audacity and <unk>
<unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
crazy.
But they were the '80s, that was great.
We all spent the commercial centers, we moved to the neighborhoods, and there in the suburbs, we can create our own erotic <unk>
These fantasies could be <unk> to the French, or Italian <unk>
Maybe with a little bit of bread.
This is what happens with the <unk>
This is what happens to the symbols.
They're easy, they're cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, we need memories of other places.
I know very well, and you all know this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
The architects feel frustrated and we start to swing the pendulum again in the other direction.
In the 1980s and early '90s, we started experimenting with the so-called <unk>
<unk> the symbols -- we now have new design techniques -- and we find ourselves with new <unk> a little bit of ways that are attached against other forms.
This is an academic and <unk> and it's <unk> You get totally <unk>
Normally, the pendulum <unk> again in the opposite direction.
But then, something <unk>
In 1997, it opened this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building changed the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when academics and public and public in general, they were completely completely aware of a building.
The New York Times <unk> this building of <unk>
<unk> in Bilbao grew up in a half a half percent when they finished the building.
So all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everyone wanted one, and Frank was everywhere.
He was our first architect who was a star.
But how is it possible that these wild forms and <unk> how it might be possible to become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media was <unk> around them, and we quickly learned that those shapes and <unk>
We've created an emotional reaction with these forms.
The main mayors in the world.
So everybody believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon in the new survey happened with other star architects.
It went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few elite architects in the threshold of the new millennium, actually started going through all of architecture. The digital media began to increase the speed of information consumption together.
Imagine for example, how do we use architecture.
A thousand years ago, I'd have to have to walk up to the next village to see a building.
And shipping is <unk> they can take a boat, a plane, can be <unk>
<unk> technology, you can see in the newspapers, on TV, and in the end, we all are photographers from architecture, and the building is transported beyond their physical location.
The architecture is everywhere now; that means that the speed of communications has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture moves so fast,
It doesn't have a lot of time to think about a building.
You need a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and in that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 more buildings more before knowing if that I designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there's never been good feedback in architecture.
That's how we met buildings like this.
The <unk> was not a <unk> movement, but 20 years.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much the <unk>
That's never going to happen, <unk> because we are in the threshold of the biggest revolution in architecture from the invention of the steel or steel or the <unk> and it's the media revolution.
My theory is that when you apply it to the media, it starts to swing faster and faster, until it gets to be in both extremes almost in <unk> and it's actually <unk> the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, the architects, and you, the public.
Now we can make symbols almost <unk> with emotional charge of something completely new.
Let me show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in the state of New York City.
It's a community of vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building, was already part of the community, and like the drawings looked exactly the stuff done, there was no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community. That first summer, when people began to get in and shared it in social media, the building stopped being a building, it became a medium of communication, because these are not just images of a building, it's the images that you made from the building.
And as you use it to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative, and that makes it <unk> with the collective memory, and to charge these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell each other what about architecture, because digital media has not only changed the relationship between us, but have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think about a second in those librarians of <unk>
If that building was built today, first of all, <unk> the Internet for <unk> <unk>
<unk> bombarded with examples of <unk> of innovation, what can be a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that can lead the mayor of <unk> to people in <unk> and tell them that there are no unique response to what a library can be today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom to experience.
Everything is different now.
The architects are no longer those very mysterious creatures that use <unk> words and tiny drawings, and one is no longer a <unk> audience who does not have seen before.
The architects can listen, and you don't get <unk> by architecture.
That means that <unk> <unk> of one style to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find right solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that the buildings in the morning will be very different than the buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad historical imitation of red brick based on ideas of what a <unk>
This means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we finally will be ready for the shapes that are going to produce.
That means that buildings <unk> to the whims of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a <unk> garage in Miami Beach, Florida, it can also serve to do sport or to <unk> or even one can be married at night.
This means that three architects can dream of swimming in the East Side of New York, and raising half a million dollars from the community attached around that cause, is no longer a client alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little pavilion of <unk> so <unk> and <unk> like the animals that are there.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot that builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what matters is what we build.
The architects already know how to make more effective buildings and more kind.
We've been waiting for all of you.
Finally, we're not on <unk>
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot in play.
The buildings not only reflect our society, but they give it way to the most <unk> spaces, local libraries where we form our children, and the bathroom <unk>
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just got a year and he started walking.
And it makes it very very typical of the children of a year, <unk> as if your body was moving too fast for their legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that you like to do for the moment is to look at the mirror.
She really loves her reflection.
<unk> and <unk> and it gives themselves those big kisses and <unk>
It's beautiful.
And apparently, all of his friends do this and my mom tells me that I used to do this. And when did I stop doing this?
How do we suddenly be comfortable with our <unk>
Because, apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking at sound, "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years old, and he lives in <unk>
And as any teenager just wants to be dear and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for the next week in school.
It has a bit of fear, it's a little bit confused because, although his mom tells him all the time it's beautiful, every day in the school, someone tells him it's ugly.
Between what his mom tells him and what his friends, or fellow from the school said, "You don't know who they believe.
So a video of her himself, he publishes it on YouTube, and he asks others for me to leave a <unk> "I'm nice or I'm a <unk>
Well, so far, <unk> has received more than 13,000 <unk>
Some of these are so <unk> that doesn't even deserve to think about them.
We talk about a regular healthy teenager and <unk> who gets these answers in one of the most vulnerable of life of their life emotionally.
Thousands of people are posting videos like this, in most teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what is it doing to do this?
Well, teenagers today are almost never alone.
They're under pressure to be online and available all the time, talking about <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> this never ends.
Never before we have been so connected, in fact, <unk> so young.
As a mother said, "It's like a party in his room all <unk>
There's just no privacy.
And social pressures that go from hand with that are <unk>
This environment, that is always connected to our children to <unk> based on the number of liked that they have and the kinds of comments that they get.
There is no divide between a life online and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what's real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very hard to know the difference between what is authentic and what we've rigged digitally.
What is the greatest thing in the life of someone in front of someone in front of a normal context in a day?
And where are they looking for the <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> of the news of girls now.
<unk> size remain <unk> our <unk>
The <unk> technique is now a routine.
And <unk> like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of you, <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in popular culture.
It's not hard to see what young people are.
But the kids are not immune to this.
Like the <unk> of the sport, and the singers, <unk>
But what is the problem with all this?
Well, we probably want our children to grow healthy and be poor individuals.
But in a culture obsessed with the image, we're teaching our children to spend more time and make mental effort in their appearance, the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical capacities -- their studies and other aspects start to suffer.
Six in 10 girls prefer to do something because they think they don't see nice enough.
These are not <unk>
They are fundamental activities for its growth as human beings and how to get society to society and the business development camp.
31 -- almost one of three teenagers are not interested in the classroom in the classroom, they will participate in the classroom <unk> because they don't want to call attention for their physical form.
One in five are not attending class at all the days when they don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the season of tests, if you don't think you're good enough, specifically if you don't think you're sufficiently thin, <unk> a smaller note to the average of your fellow partners who don't care about how you look like this.
And this phenomenon has been widespread in Finland, the U.S. and China.
And it takes care of what they actually weigh these young people.
So for course, to be pretty clear, we're talking about how you see you not about how you are.
The low self-esteem on their body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
<unk> with little self-esteem do less physical activity, they eat less fruit and vegetables, participate in more diet not healthy than they can bring them to a food disorder.
They have low self-esteem.
They are more easily <unk> by the people around them and are in higher risk of depression.
And we think that's because of all of this because of what they make more intentional decisions, like the consumption of alcohol and drugs, diets -- the aesthetic surgery at the early ages of early ages and no protection and harm damage.
The search for the perfect body is pushing into the healthcare system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe they are overweight again, regardless of whether they have or don't have higher rates of <unk>
17 percent of women don't present a job interview in a day where they don't feel safe with the way you see.
Think about a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would that be?"
This potential is about interest for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, by itself, doesn't get you very far.
Isn't it enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key shapes -- the first one is that we have to instill trust in their own body.
We need to help our teenagers to develop strategies to overcome the pressure of the perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are many programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very impressed by when I learned that a lot of <unk> programs without realizing the situation.
So we need to make sure that the program will follow our children will not only have a positive impact, but also a lasting impact.
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on six key areas, the first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects are crucial points for anyone willing to provide a body self-esteem that works.
A education is a foundation, but tackle this problem requires each of us to take the reins in the issue and be a better model to follow women and girls in our own lives.
It really challenging the current status of how women are seen and mentioned in our circles.
It's not good to tell you with the contribution of our politicians in <unk> or the size of your <unk> or the size of your <unk> or the success of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to begin to judge people for what they are, not because of how you see.
We can all start by doing it by assuming the responsibility for the kind of images and comments that we published in our social networks.
We can take people on their own effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you. When was the last time you would get a <unk>
In short, we need to work together like communities, such as governments and as businesses, to truly change our culture, so that our children will grow to be valuing their whole person, valuing individuality, of <unk>
We need to put people who are actually making the difference in a <unk>
To make a difference in the real world, let's make them the ones that go out on the big screen because we just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they believe that you see that they will never be <unk> of being who they are, or to reach what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in their lives.
Who is in mind?
<unk>
<unk>
<unk>
Her <unk> A <unk>
It could be simply the woman who's two car seats, and what it would mean for her if he was released from that voice to be released in his interior, which was <unk> by not having long legs -- <unk> more <unk> a smaller belly <unk>
What would it mean for her if we were doing this, and we would take your potential of that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with images is <unk> to everybody.
But we would take our children the truth.
So I think the way you see is just a part of your identity, and that the truth is that we love them for those who are and for what they do, and because of how they make us feel.
They went to self-esteem in the <unk> of our schools.
So let's change each of us, the way we talk about and compared to other people.
And <unk> together as a community, from small groups to governments, for the small <unk> of a year of age today, becoming safe agents of themselves tomorrow.
Let's do it.
On five November of 1990, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> went into a hotel in Manhattan and killed the rabbi, <unk> <unk> the leader of the League of Defense <unk>
And I was initially called it innocent -- but a prisoner for other charges -- in the company of others, started planning to plan attacks to about 12 York City, including <unk> <unk> and the United Nations.
Fortunately, those plans was being served by an FBI informant from the FBI.
Sadly, the bomb of 1993 in the World Trade Center could not be able to avoid.
Later on, they would be convicted of your participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my dad.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being a <unk> with a loving Mother Mother elementary school, elementary school teacher -- the two were all possible for giving me a happy childhood,
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a way of Islam, that very few, even most Muslims get to meet.
For experience, I saw that when people take time to interact, it doesn't require a lot to want to want the same things in life.
However, in all religion, in all of the human group, there's always a small fraction of people who are being used to their convictions that thinks that we need to use all of the possible media for everybody to live as them.
A few months before he arrest him, he sat down with me and explained that in the last purposes of week, he and some friends, had been going to training them in Long Island to practice.
He said I would go with him the next day.
We came up with <unk> <unk> which, without knowing our group, I was <unk> by the FBI.
When my father touched me, my father helped me hold the <unk> on the shoulder and explained to me how to aim for about 30 feet.
That day, with the last bullet that he shot at the little bullet that he shot at the little orange light on the goal, and to surprise you all, especially me, all of the goal broke on fire.
My uncle turned to the other and in Arabic, he said, <unk> <unk>
As a parent, such a child.
And all of all, the comment produced a lot of laughter. But only a few years later I understood what they were so funny.
Did you see in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later would be convicted of putting it together with 700 pounds of explosives in the underground parking lot of the World Trade Center, causing a explosion that killed six people and hurt other 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called it <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved back 20 times, that instability during my childhood was not allowed to do a lot of <unk>
Every time I started feeling comfortable close to someone was now <unk> and going to another city.
As I was always me the new face of the class that is often a <unk>
My identity <unk> my identity to avoid being the white. But it will be the new of the class and silent and <unk> it was enough <unk>
So most of the time I was reading books, watching books, or playing video games.
For these reasons they didn't develop social skills, to put it <unk> to grow <unk> I was not prepared for the real world.
I was opera to judge people, based on <unk> <unk> like their race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that they put in the test is for the presidential election of 2000.
In a <unk> program, where I was involved in the National Institute in Philadelphia.
My group was <unk> in the subject of juvenile violence, as I had been victim of <unk> almost all my life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from different <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I discovered that one of the kids who we had done was, friendship, was Jewish her.
I took a number of days to go to light this detail and realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I'd never had a Jewish friend of mine, and I was quite proud to have been able to overcome the barrier that all life was made to me to believe it was <unk>
Another crucial moment emerged when I got a summer job, in Bush -- a <unk> park.
I found myself with people of all kinds of beliefs and cultures, and that experience was fundamental in the development of my character.
All life had taught me that <unk> was a sin and for extension, all gay people were bad <unk>
And I didn't have the opportunity to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the most nice and less critics who had seen in life.
Having been <unk> as a child, I developed a sense of empathy towards the suffering of others, but it was not easy for me to treat people differently in the way as I would be treated.
For that feeling I could contrast the stereotypes that I had taught me as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know how it is to be homosexual but I know what is to be used by something beyond my control.
Then he came up with the <unk> <unk>
All night, Jon Stewart made me <unk> honest with my <unk> and it helped me see that race of people, religion or sexual orientation, you have nothing to do with character.
In many ways he became my <unk> figure at a moment when I was desperately <unk>
In occasions, the inspiration can come from the unexpected. And that an Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life than my own father, <unk> was not in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my way to think, and she told me something that keep in my heart forever, while he's alive.
She looked at me with my eyes tired of someone who has suffered enough with endless <unk> and he said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that moment I realized how much negative energy you need to keep all that hatred in your inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed it when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why do I decided to go out and put myself in a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I have done it because I hope that someone, one day, which is about bringing my story to the violence, I can hear my story and understand that there is a better path, that even though I gave me to this violent ideology and <unk> I didn't get to make me <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against the prejudice.
I do it for the victims of terrorism and because of their loved pain and the losses that terrorism has produced in their lives.
For the victims of terrorism to speak against those acts of <unk> as rejection to the actions of my father.
With this <unk> I put here as proof that violence is not inherent to any religion or race, which kids don't have to follow their parents.
I'm not my dad.
Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.
At this point, there is a film that's projects in your minds.
It's an incredible movie <unk>
It's in 3D, and it has <unk> sound of what you hear and you see right now. But that's just the beginning.
Your film has flavor and texture.
It feels your body, your pain, your hunger your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, like your childhood moments that project to your eyes.
And it has always a voice superimposed on your own conscious thought.
The heart of the movie is you who experience everything anywhere.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of the mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths in the existence of being human.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an inner film, you and you, you and you.
There is nothing to make it more directly.
At least, I know I have a <unk>
I have no certainty that you are aware of.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we were not conscious -- nothing in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time it's the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why have these films <unk>
Why are we not just robots, that we get to produce results without experiencing the movie <unk>
At this moment, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate awareness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible a science of consciousness.
The science, by nature, is objective it.
<unk> by nature, is subjective things.
So there can never be a science of consciousness.
Because for most of the 20th century, <unk> that vision.
The psychology was studying behavioral behavior, the neuroscience of the <unk> brain, but never just mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there was very few scientists on consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the moment for science <unk> <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a <unk> of the scientific work on consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of consciousness in the recent years was the pursuit of <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw something about this guy in the fantastic work I presented Nancy <unk> a few minutes.
We now understand a lot better, for example, brain areas that are related to the conscious experience of looking at faces or feeling pain or feeling happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science of explanations.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experiences, but we don't know why.
I'd like to tell you that this kind of work of neuroscience is responding some questions that we want to explain your consciousness. The questions about what certain areas of the brain are and what they would be like.
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
<unk> <unk>
Actually, there is no easy problem with consciousness.
Well, it doesn't address the real mystery of this <unk> why all physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is this an inner <unk>
Right now, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give it a few years to the neuroscience.
It's going to turn into another emerging phenomenon like <unk> like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The classic <unk> are all cases of emerging behaviors, how do they operate <unk> how they work <unk> how they are <unk> how they adapt and <unk> the living organisms -- all of them are questions about how to target a goal.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon, how we are talking about how we play <unk> all questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior are between easy problems.
But the hard problem is the question of why is that all behavior is accompanied by a <unk> experience.
And here's the standard paradigm of <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually, still doesn't have a lot to say.
I'm a <unk> <unk>
I want a scientific theory of <unk> that works. For a long time, I was beating my head against the wall for a theory of consciousness in pure physical terms that would work.
But at the end I came to the conclusion that that didn't work for <unk> reasons.
I think we're going to tell us at this point.
We have a chain of unintended explanations. We got used to this; the physics explains the chemistry, chemistry explains biology, explains a part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit into this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we are conscious.
On the other hand, we don't know how to <unk> that idea to our scientific view of the world.
I think that consciousness, right now, is kind of a <unk> something that we need to integrate to our view of the world, but we don't even know how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that at the beginning of crazy <unk> before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There's some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today has one.
Their crazy idea is that there is no such problem that there's a hard problem for consciousness.
The whole idea of the visual visual movie includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
In fact, what you need to do, is to explain the brain functions, the behaviors of the brain -- and this is what everything needs explanation.
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of consciousness purely <unk> based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for a lot of others, that vision is pretty close to simply denying that the observation of consciousness is satisfying
But I'm going in a different direction.
In the time that left, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
<unk> sometimes take some aspects of the universe as expensive building space, the space and the mass.
<unk> fundamental laws that <unk> like the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties don't explain in terms of any more basic terms.
Instead, they think of fundamental, and the world is constructed.
Sometimes, the list of the fundamental thing is <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> discovered that you can't explain the electric phenomena in terms of fundamental fundamental concepts -- space, and then <unk> the basic laws of <unk> and <unk> the electric charge as a fundamental concept that those laws <unk>
I think that's the situation that we find in consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental fundamental ideas -- space mass, time, charge of logic, you have to <unk> the list.
The most natural thing would be <unk> consciousness as a fundamental <unk> a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that it is suddenly not the object of science.
It opens the path to <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness with other core concepts -- the space, the time, the mass, the mass, the <unk>
<unk> sometimes tell you that we want the fundamental laws so simple that we can put them into a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws so simple that we could put them into a t-shirt.
We don't know what laws are, but that's what we need.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Each system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> for mind, and every system is conscious -- not only humans, the dogs, the mice, the flies, the microbes of Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be full of heartbreak when I think <unk> always traveling at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, that's not.
But thinking is that maybe photons can have some element of crude <unk> to give you some <unk> of consciousness.
This can sound a little crazy for you.
How would someone think that <unk>
And part of this comes from the first crazy idea that consciousness is a fundamental thing.
If it's fundamental, like space, and time and mass, it's natural to assume that it can also be universal, just like others.
It's also worth noticing that although the idea seems to be <unk> is much less for the people of different cultures, where the human mind seems more a continuum with nature.
A deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the most simple and powerful way to find fundamental laws that are going to address the thinking with the physical process, is <unk> the consciousness with information.
Whenever there's information processing, there is awareness.
<unk> of complex <unk> as a human being aware of complex awareness.
<unk> of simple, consciousness is simple.
Something very exciting is that in recent years, a neuroscientist, <unk> <unk> took this type of theory, and I developed it with mathematical methods.
It has a measure of mathematical integration of information, which is called <unk> which measures the level of information integrated in a system.
And I am supposed to have to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of integration of information, a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there is a degree of integration of information, as well as significant of consciousness quite important.
But when you get to the worms, microbes, the particles, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of integration of information is smaller -- but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there will still be a level of a different awareness of zero.
In fact offers a fundamental law law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Moreover, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate consciousness to the physical world.
<unk> and philosophers are often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but we don't talk about the reality underlying the underlying reality.
As Stephen Hawking's Hawking's "Where is the fire of the <unk>
From <unk> <unk> the equations of physics can be able to leave as they are, but you can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is the one that he puts on the equations.
In that vision, consciousness doesn't find out of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right there in the center.
This vision, I think, <unk> vision has the potential to <unk> our relationship with nature, and it can have social and ethical and ethical and ethical consequences.
Some of them can be <unk>
I used to think that I shouldn't eat anything to have consciousness, then I should be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you accept that vision, you'll get a lot of hunger.
I think that thinking about it, this tends to transform your <unk> whereas what it matters in ethical terms, and moral <unk> is not so much the fact of consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask awareness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of the information -- she has a complicated information processing, so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, they are doing very serious ethical problems about the ethic of the development of smart computers and the ethic of <unk>
Finally, you can ask for the consciousness of global collective collective the planet.
Canada has its own consciousness?
Or a more local level, an integrated group like the audience at a TED Talk, we have a collective consciousness -- an internal film for this whole group of TED, different from the inner movies of each of the <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least a question that needs to take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's right.
Actually, I'm more sure about the first crazy idea that consciousness is a fundamental thing that is a fundamental thing that is universal.
So vision raises a lot of questions, so many challenges, like, how those little bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness that we know and love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going through the right path to a theory of serious consciousness.
If not, well, it's probably the most difficult problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve it at night in the morning.
But I think we're finally going to find it.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we need the crazy crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a little rural village on Victoria.
He had a very normal profile, an <unk> of education.
I went to school, I was obsessed with my friends, I was excited with my younger sisters.
Everything was very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to get a community in the community.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice but there's a real problem.
She's actually not <unk>  And they were right.
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had a low profile in the <unk> of my mother, and I spent a lot of time looking at the <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yeah, yeah. What contradiction.
But they were right.
I did nothing that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be considered as a achievement if we take the disability out of the equation.
Years later, I was in the second part of teaching in a high school of <unk> as only after 20 minutes in the middle of the 11th of <unk> a guy raised his hand and said, "Hey, when will you get your <unk>
And I said, <unk>
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for a good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk> speech.
When people in the wheels, they talk about <unk> things at school?"
Usually in the classroom.
And it was then when I realized, this child had had experiences with disabled people as an inspiration.
And we don't know, and it's not the fault of the boy, I mean, that's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We're not real people. We are there to inspire them.
And in fact, I'm on this stage <unk> to what I do in this wheelchair, and you're probably waiting for you. Right?  Yes.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid <unk> <unk>
I'm not here for <unk>
I'm here to tell you that we've lied to be lied to our disability.
Yes, they have sold us the lie that disability is <unk> A capital <unk>
It's something bad and living with a disability makes you <unk>
It's not a bad thing, and it doesn't make you <unk>
And over the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk>
Or this <unk> <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a lot of them.
It may be that you've seen one of the girl without drawing with a pencil held by the mouth.
You may have seen a kid who runs with a fiber of carbon fiber.
And there's a lot of these images, which are what we call <unk> <unk>
And I use the term porn -- because we would take a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, we will engage the disabled people in the benefit of people without disability.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so that we can see them and think, "Well, for very bad that it is my life, it might be worse.
I could be that person.
But if you're that person?
I've lost the number of times the number of times that I have been approached by strange <unk> to express that you think I'm brave or an source of inspiration, and this was going to happen before my work had a public profile.
It was as if I was going to get me up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, those images are associated with people with disabled people with no disability.
They're there so you can see them and think that things are not so bad for you, or to put your concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually a tough person.
Some things are <unk>
But the things that we expect is not the things that you can think.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I was called the social model of disability, that tells us that we are more disabled because of the society that we live in because of our bodies or <unk>
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very excited about it.
It makes things that I need to do, and I've learned how best of your ability as well as you do, and that's what happens with the children of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything out of the commons.
They are simply using their bodies by taking the best of their ability.
So it's really fair to behave in the way we do that, by sharing those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it says it as a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, because they have sold this lie that disability makes us quite remarkable to us.
And honestly, it doesn't do.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> the inspiration, and you think, "Oh God, you're not going to be inspired by anything?"
And I actually know I am.
<unk> from other disabled people at all time.
However, I don't know that I'm younger than them.
<unk> this is a great idea to use <unk> <unk> to collect the things that they fall over.  <unk> the clever trick of how to charge your mobile phone battery in the battery battery.
Great.
We learn from the force and resistance of others, not our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that <unk> and <unk>
I really believe that that lie that they have been sold about disability is the biggest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that's lie because it's not true, because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles at a range of stairs has never done it to become a <unk>
Never.   <unk> to a television screen will not get the <unk> for people to <unk>
Not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude to turn all those books into the <unk>
It's simply not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not the exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15 year-old girl sitting in his bedroom watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> don't be considered no <unk> of nothing to be in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low expectations of the people who are disability to be <unk> by climbing up from bed and remembering our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the genuine achievement of people with disabilities, and I want to live in a world where a kid at 11 grade in Melbourne is not a little surprised that his new teacher is a <unk>
The disability doesn't make us <unk> but questioning what you think about what you do.
Thank you.
What do you have to look at augmented reality and a professional football with the <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, today just respond to one of those questions, so please don't get <unk>
When people think about <unk> they think about <unk> <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but <unk> reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that will happen in our days and it will happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know it, because augmented reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So, how did we get to reality <unk>
The first step, is what I wear <unk> Google <unk>
I'm sure many of you are familiar with them.
What you might not know is that Google <unk> are a device that lets you see what I see.
It will allow you to experience what is to be a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to make it <unk>
I have to use words.
So I have to create a framework that you will do with your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, underneath a helmet and knowing what is running by the game of playing <unk> the blood hitting the ears.
We can know that it feels like a man in 110 pounds, we were trying to make it <unk> with all his self.
I've been there and I assure you, it's not nice.
I would have some videos to show you what is to use Google <unk> under the helmet, and give them an idea of it.
Unfortunately, it's not images from the practices of <unk> because the idea of <unk> technology is an submarine going up to the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's see a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible to be <unk>
A moment <unk> a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what is to be <unk> in the football field from the perspective of the <unk>
You may have realized that we lack people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of these, <unk> from the University of Washington.
<unk> from <unk> Mice <unk> mice.
Blue eight, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more about being in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
<unk> want that experience.
The fans want to be in the field, will be their favorite players and you have asked me on YouTube and <unk> it can see from the angle of a field of <unk>
or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how we get out of <unk> how we take it to the next <unk>
We took it to that level using something called <unk> <unk> that surely a lot of it.
The Rift Valley has been described as the most realistic virtual reality apparatus ever created, and it's not cheap.
And I'm going to show you why, by this video.
Man: Oh.
No, no, no, no, no, no. I don't want to keep <unk> No!
Oh, my God. Ah!
<unk> That's the experience of a man in a Russian mountain, <unk> for his life.
What will the experience of a fan of a fan when you put a video of Adrian walking across the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before he run and make a <unk> What is the experience of a fan of a fan.
When I can be <unk> running through the <unk> launching the ball to the bottom of the network?
What is your experience when you go from a mountain to over 100 miles like a <unk> <unk>
Maybe they were <unk> <unk> <unk> for adults.
But this is not even <unk>
It's just virtual reality, <unk>
How do we get to reality <unk> <unk>
<unk> reality is augmented reality when the <unk> and the owners look at the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to win. They give them money.
So, here's a quick focus on technology in the <unk>
In 1965, the Baltimore <unk> put a <unk> to his field of field so that he would play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to <unk>
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> placed radios in the <unk> of the field <unk> and then in the <unk>
They had more viewers because it was faster, more fun.
In <unk> imagine that they are a player coming back to your group and you see your next one that you're shown in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that you carry on on it, you don't have to worry about just a <unk>
Or to memorize the strategy.
They just go out to the field and <unk>
And the coaches want it because if you don't follow their instructions, they lose them, and they hate to lose games.
If you lose games like a coach.
And they don't want that.
But augmented reality is not just a manual of <unk> strategies.
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve the game.
How would you do?
Well, a very simple option would be having a camera in every corner of the stadium, having a view from the top of the people who are down.
You also get information from the <unk> and the <unk> something that is already working on.
And all that information is sent to your players.
The good teams will know <unk>
The bad people will have information <unk>
This is going to ask the good teams of the bad guys.
So your computer equipment is going to be as important as your <unk> and analysis analysis to stop being <unk>
It's also to <unk> Who would have <unk>
How would it be in the <unk>
Imagine that they are the field <unk>
They put the ball and <unk>
They went to a open receiver -- all of a sudden, a <unk> on the left of your bombsight -- you would tell you that a defense behind you is going to <unk> Usually not <unk> but the system of <unk> will <unk>
<unk> to the protection.
Another <unk> <unk> that there is a <unk>
<unk> the <unk> but they <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where to land. But yet the receptor sees its bombsight -- an area of grass that lights and can modify the career.
<unk> <unk> <unk> runs and <unk>
The <unk> <unk> and the fans have followed it from each angle.
This is something that creates massive emotion in the game.
I'm going to do that lots of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
The fans want to be in the field,
They want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of sports because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I wonder is, we want this to be the only use of <unk> reality.
We're going to use it only as bread and <unk> like our <unk> entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to foster empathy between human beings to show someone what it is, literally, be in the place of another person.
We know what this technology is worth <unk>
It generates billions of dollars a year.
But how much is this technology for a teacher in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how bad their actions are from the perspective of <unk>
How much is this technology for a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how it lives being <unk>
How much is it worth a <unk> or an Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more in space and science instead of <unk> <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality is coming.
The questions that we do, the decisions we take and the challenges that we face, <unk> as always, for us.
Thank you.
I recently <unk> after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years old, I spent the southern tip of <unk> County.
The bridge is a <unk> structure known to the world by its beautiful view of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean -- and its inspiring architectural style.
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden Gate bridge was opened in <unk>
Joseph <unk> engineer by building the bridge, said that, "The bridge is pretty much <unk>
suicide from the bridge is no practical or <unk>
But from their openness, over 1,600 people have jumped to death from that bridge.
Some believe that traveling between the two towers will lead to another dimension, this bridge has become <unk> such as the each of it is released from all your concerns and pain, and the waters that pass under <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that it happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After one every five to five seconds, the body bumps against the water about 120 miles an hour.
The impact breaks bone, and some of which will be living vital organs.
Most of us die in the impact.
The ones that don't normally have been <unk> in the water -- and then they <unk>
I don't think that the <unk> this method of suicide has to realize the death of the <unk> the death of the <unk>
This is the wire.
Except about the two towers, there's 32 inches of parallel steel to the bridge.
This is where most people are before they had to take their life.
I can tell you about experience that once the person is on that edge, and in the most dark moment, it's very hard to bring it back.
I took this photo last year as a young man talking to a officer looking at her life.
I want to tell you very much that we had the success that day to bring it back on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we had no formal training.
So let's take the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those who were giving the suicide, but the officials as well.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, veterans and psychologists train the new government.
This is Jason <unk>
I met him January 22, last year by getting a call of a possible suicide bomber sitting on the <unk> near the center.
<unk> and when I got there, he looked at Jason talking to one of the Golden Golden <unk>
Jason was only 32 years old, and he had flown down here from New Jersey.
In fact, he had flown up to two times before from New Jersey to try to kill suicide from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> we asked us if we knew the story of the box of <unk>
<unk> the mythology -- <unk> <unk> created <unk> and sent to the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could be more than <unk> and she opened the box.
Of course, they came out <unk> <unk> and all kinds of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason said, "What happens if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped a few <unk> leaned on the right, and he left.
This kind of smart boy in New Jersey had just taken away from life.
I talked to the parents of Jason <unk> that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the following day, the family rabbi called me to see how I was.
The parents of Jason had <unk>
<unk> damage affect a lot of people.
They ask them these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or someone loved to be <unk>
What do you find?
What does it mean?
In my experience, you don't only talk about, but you need to listen to it.
Listening to understand.
Don't <unk> <unk> or tell the person you know how to feel, because they probably won't.
Just being there, you can be the inflection point they need.
If you think that someone is <unk> you're not afraid of <unk> and ask the question.
One way to ask you the question is, <unk> in similar circumstances have thought to end their life, you've had these <unk>
They went to the person in front of them can save life and be the inflection point for them.
Other signs in <unk> despair, believe that things are terrible and they're never going to be able to believe it, believe that there's nothing you can do with the <unk> social isolation and a lost interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read you your letter.
She lost his son on the January of January this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days, and it's with his permission and blessing that I read it.
"Hi, <unk> I guess you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking that I should go to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends that tell your friends, etc.
I'm still quite <unk> but noticing more moments of realization that Mike won't go home.
Mike was driving from <unk> to San Francisco to see the <unk> party with his father the 19 <unk>
It never came there.
I called the police of <unk> and they <unk> it as the disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officials came to my house and told me that the Mike car was down on the bridge.
A witness I'd seen it jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the day before.
Thank you very much for fighting those who may be temporarily too weak to fight themselves.
Who hasn't been wrong before without suffering a real mental illness.
It shouldn't be so easy to finish with it.
My prayers are with you for your fight.
The <unk> the Golden Gate Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful bay, not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and go through the way his son took that day, and also the value to go forward.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean with hope and value.
On March of March of 2005, I wrote to a radio call by a <unk> suicide bomber on the sidewalk near the northern tower.
I <unk> my bike, and I looked at this man, Kevin <unk> standing on the sidewalk.
When he saw me, he crossed immediate <unk> and stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
During the hour and the next year, I heard as Kevin talked about his depression and despair.
Kevin decided for his mind that day back to that lane and give the life another opportunity.
When Kevin <unk> I got it.
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I said, "What was it that he made <unk> and gave the hope and the life is <unk>
And you know what told me?
He said, "Do you <unk>
I stopped talking and just <unk>
Soon after that incident, I got a letter from the mother of Kevin, and I have that card with me, and I would like to <unk>
"Dear Mr. <unk> nothing to erase the 11 o'clock events in March, and you're one of the reasons why Kevin is still with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
He's been diagnosed with a mental illness which has been correctly correctly for which it has been done.
I went to Kevin when I only had six months, completely unconscious of all those traits <unk> but thank God, we now know.
Kevin is in order, as the say.
We thank God for you.
<unk> with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end, she wrote <unk> When I visited San Francisco at San Francisco at San Francisco that night, you're going to hang out like the patient.
<unk> I had to <unk>
Today, Kevin is a <unk> father and a active member of society.
It speaks openly about the events of that day and his depression with the hope that their story inspire others.
suicide is not just something I've found in work.
It's personal.
My grandfather was <unk> with poison.
That act, despite the end of his own pain, theft.
This is what the suicide.
For most people who are <unk> or those who considered suicide, you wouldn't think they hurt another person.
They just want your own pain <unk>
And usually this is achieved only three things: or the drugs or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illness and suicide calls around the bridge.
From those incidents that I've been directly involved, I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who told him about an hour.
And for that time, I would get my hand up at three times.
In the end, it looked at me, and he said, "I am sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely awful.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of the people we get to contact on that bridge is not <unk>
In addition, those few who have jumped from the bridge and lived and that you can talk about it, that one percent or two percent, most of those people have said that the second one who leaves the <unk> they realized they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge is not only connected to <unk> with San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or the bridge that we do, is something that all and every one of us should be able to be <unk>
suicide can prevent.
Is there hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you don't are, but in your inside you know what you are, and a question <unk> How do you tell you about that?
I have to be something only in that sense, but I'm not alone in any way I'm alone.
When I became a model I felt that I had finally achieved the dream that I had since a child.
My outside finally <unk> with my inner truth, with my inner myself.
For complicated reasons, what I'm going to go over later, when I look later at this picture, I'm thinking, you know, I was going to do it -- you know, I would have it <unk>
But last October, I discovered that, <unk> I'm starting to see it.
We would all embrace our families, our religion, our society, our society in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the value of <unk> to get rid of the limitations of imposed by the color of the skin or the beliefs of those around us.
They are people who always defy the status quo, which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors, many of my friends, my agent even ignored my story.
I think this mystery is called <unk>
This is mine.
I was recorded as a <unk> at birth because of the appearance of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, I would always wear this t-shirt on my head.
And my mom asked me, "Why are you always wearing that t-shirt in the <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair -- I'm a <unk>
I knew then how to <unk>
The gender is always considered a <unk> but now we know that in fact, it's a more complex and mystery thing.
Because of my success, I would never give me to share my story, not because I thought it will be bad, but because of how the world comes to those of us who want to <unk>
Every day I appreciate is a woman.
I have a mama, Dad and a family who accept me as I am.
Many are not so lucky.
There's a long tradition in the Asian culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a <unk> goddess of <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines that celebrated these puzzles.
I was in front of the stage and I remember this beautiful woman came up to me, and I remember that moment as if something <unk> me -- this is the kind of woman I wanted to be.
And when I was 15, when I was still wearing a man, I met this woman named <unk>
It's the director of a beautiful beauty competition.
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you been involved in the contest of <unk>
He told me that if you <unk> she was responsible for <unk> and <unk> and that night, I won in the bathroom suit. He won in <unk> and he was a <unk> a third woman between over 40 candidates.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty.
Not a lot of people can say that their first job was to queen of beauty of women, but I can.
I also met the goddess of <unk> especially when they were <unk> to <unk> <unk>
But more importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001 my mom.
I was shocked.
I told my mother, "Mommy, I'm <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen of <unk>
But then, two weeks later, I called me and said, "Do you know that if you hit the United States, you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested that I was two <unk> to my name.
She also sat down when I was standing in Thailand to the 19 years.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities in Thailand do the most <unk> sophisticated surgeries and secure.
In that time in the United States, it was necessary to do surgery before the name and the gender.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driver's license with the name of <unk> and the female <unk>
It was a great time.
For some people, their identity document means to be able to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me was the license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly, my fears saw <unk>
I felt that I could conquer my dream and move to New York City, and be model.
Many are not so lucky.
I think of this woman in <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York City who was living in his truth, but he <unk> his life really <unk>
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All of November 20, we do a global <unk> for <unk> Day.
I'm on this stage, thanks to a long story of people who were <unk> and stood up to injustice.
These are guilty P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep in living my truth and just for me.
I want to do the best to help others to live their truth without shame, not fear.
I'm here, <unk> for one day there is no more <unk> than 20 of <unk>
My deepest truth took me to accept what I am.
I'll do you?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Sure. First of all, thank you with all my <unk>
To my support network, my parents especially, my family, who is really very strong.
I remember all the times that I have been to young young women who have been calling me and sometimes when they were called me and told me that his parents couldn't embrace it, and they would tell me that her parents couldn't embrace it, he took the phone, he said, "Mommy, can you call this <unk>
Sometimes it would work, other don't. It's just the identity of the center of what we are, right?
I mean, everybody was assigned a gender at birth, and what I'm trying to do is put on the table the subject that sometimes that task doesn't block and that there should be a space that would allow people to <unk> and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
<unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
It should have understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and ask questions, and I hope you all are my allies.
KS: Thank you. Very little. <unk> Thank you.
In many <unk> societies and tribal societies, the parents are usually known for their kids, but I'm one of the parents who are known for her daughter, and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started her campaign for education defending their rights in 2007. And when their efforts went to <unk> the National <unk> Prize <unk> became very <unk> a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you take a look at the history of humanity, the story of women is the story of the <unk> of the inequality, of violence and exploitation.
You see, in <unk> societies right from the beginning, when when when I was born a girl, his birth is not <unk>
It's not a welcoming or his father, nor for his mother.
The neighborhood comes, he gives your <unk> to the mother and no one <unk> the father.
And a mother was getting a lot to get a little girl.
When he gives birth to the first girl, the first daughter, it gets sad.
When he gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and, with the hope of a son, when he was <unk> his third daughter, feels guilty like a criminal.
Not only did your mother suffering, but the daughter. The <unk> daughter when it grows, it suffers as well.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, she got home and school admits of the siblings.
At the age of 12 years, somehow, it has a good life.
Can you be <unk>
You can play with your friends on the street, and it can move through the streets as a butterfly.
But when you go into adolescence, when I was 13 years old, it's a claim to get out of her house without a male <unk>
It's confined to the four walls of their house.
It's no longer a free person.
It becomes the honor of his father and his brothers and her brothers and his family, and if you <unk> the code of that thing, honor, the could even kill.
And it's interesting that this idea of honor, it doesn't only affect the life of a <unk> also affecting the life of male members of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the joys of his life and happiness from his sisters in the name of honor.
And there's a norm more than <unk> societies called <unk>
It's supposed to be a good girl who must be very humble and very <unk>
It's the judgment.
The model of a good girl must be <unk>
It's supposed to be silent and it accepts the decisions of their father and mother and mother decisions even if they don't will.
If you hit it, with a man who doesn't like or if you hit her, with a old man has to <unk> because it doesn't want to be <unk> of <unk>
If the <unk> very young, you have to follow it.
Otherwise, the <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In the words of a <unk> "The <unk> and then it gives birth to more children and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson of <unk> to his daughter, and the same lesson of honor to his children.
And this vicious cycle continues and continues.
<unk> brothers and sisters, when I was born, believe me, I don't like the newborns, to be honest, but when I was there and looked at his eyes, believe me, I felt extremely <unk>
And so much before I was trying to think about his name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of the freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> of <unk> and I called my daughter so for her.
But when I was <unk> all of them were men, and I grabbed my pen, and I took a line of my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she grew, when she went on, when I was four and a half and a half and a half years in my school.
You might ask, why should I mention a girl in a girl in a school?
Yes, I must <unk>
They can give it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developing countries, but in the poor countries, in tribal societies, it's a great event for the life of a child.
<unk> in a school means the recognition of his identity and his name.
One drove to school means that it's entered the world of dreams and the aspirations where it can explore their potential for their future life.
I have five sisters, and no one of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks earlier, when they were <unk> the form of a <unk> Canada, and was in the relative to the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason was I had never seen the names of my sisters written in any document.
That was the reason for my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters and his daughters, thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and <unk> of my daughter.
<unk> to sit with me when my friends came to me.
The encouraged to go with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to focus on their personality.
And this was not just for her, just for <unk>
I've got all these good values in my school to girls and kids for the same way.
I used education for <unk>
<unk> my daughters, taught students to forget the lesson of <unk>
I taught the students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, <unk> for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we met a new phenomenon.
It was lethal rights for human rights, and in particular, for women's rights.
It was called <unk>
That means a complete denial of participation of women in all of the political, economic and social.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
The girls were banned to go to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to markets.
The musicians were <unk> the <unk> girls and the singers who were <unk>
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was terrifying to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk about their rights.
It's really terrifying.
At the age of 10, <unk> got up and raised for the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the blog blog who was offered himself to the New York Times, and I talked about every platform that he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
They were <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason why the Taliban couldn't tolerate their campaign and the nine in October 2012, was fired in the head.
It was a day <unk> for my family and me.
The world became a great black hole.
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between life and death, he told my wife to my wife -- "I've got <unk> for what happened to my daughter, your <unk>
And <unk> said, "Please, don't give you <unk>
<unk> the fair cause.
<unk> your life in play for the cause of peace, and because of the cause of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and <unk>
They were both on the right path, and God <unk>
These few words were going a lot to me, and I didn't ask again.
When I was <unk> I was in the hospital, and I had severe headaches and his head headaches because his facial nerve was cut down, I used to see a dark shadow that would be held by the face of my wife.
But my daughter would never be <unk>
I used to say, "I'm okay with my smile, and with the <unk> in my face.
I'm going to do it well. Please do not <unk>
It was a comfort for us, and it was <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, we've learned from her how to resist the most difficult moments, and I'm happy to share with you that despite the rights of children and women, it's like any girl in 16 years.
<unk> when you don't just run his task.
They fight with your brothers, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What is special in my <unk> who has done so bold to <unk> so brave and <unk>
I mean, I don't ask me what I did.
I think I didn't know.
He didn't cut your wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> in the brain 18 years ago, and from that day, science science has become a personal passion.
I am engineering.
And I want to tell you that I've recently joined the Google group of Google, where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> -- the <unk> of Google imaging -- but all the work that I'm talking about today about the science of the brain, I made it before I met Google or outside of my work there.
Having said this, there's a stigma when you get to a brain operation.
You are still just as smart or not?
Is it not going to be like that, you might be <unk>
After <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't gray, but it was the dead part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
After the operation, I had to decide how much of a dozen of a dozen chemicals every day, because if I didn't take anything, they would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about combinations and mix of chemicals, and try to get them to stay alive.
More than once I've been saved by recently.
But thankfully, I have a soul of <unk> so I decided that I would be able to try to get the dose dose, because it really doesn't exist a clear map that tells you in <unk>
I began to test with different <unk> and I was shocked by looking at how small changes in the dose, dramatically my <unk> my sense of who I was, my way to think, my behavior with each other.
A particularly <unk> case for a few months, I was able to be doses and common chemicals for a comic man, and I was amazed at looking at how my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I thought all the time in sexual sex, and I thought it was the smartest person around the world, and --  of course, many times in the past I've met several guys like this, or perhaps some <unk> versions of it.
It turned out as a extreme.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> a lot of <unk> fixing a problem that had the front, and it just didn't happen like this.
So I couldn't handle it.
I changed my <unk>
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation of men and what they have to <unk> since then I carry better with men.
What I was trying to do is adjust those hormones and neurotransmitters and so forth, it was reclaim my intelligence after disease and <unk> my creative thought, my <unk> of ideas.
<unk> think almost always in images, and that became my key reference point -- how do I get those mental pictures that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if they were <unk> and new ideas and <unk>
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> look at the similar things.
They thought the images and the mental ideas were the same thing.
Now there are people who challenge this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how your mind works, for me is simple: for most of us, the mental images are fundamental to <unk> thinking and <unk>
So, after several years, I got to find the point right now, and I have a lot of great mental <unk> really sophisticated mental <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to bring these mental images, of my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a movie director would be able to use their imagination only to drive the world that has the <unk>
Or if a musician could extract the music of your head?
There's incredible possibilities with this, as the way people creative people can get to share the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to do this is simply to increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
So let me show you why I think we're pretty close to getting to this with two recent experiments done by two groups in neuroscience.
They are both using MRI technology, image fMRI -- to represent the brain here, you can see brain scanning by <unk> <unk> and their colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the brain scan of a person who looks at an image.
The column of the middle shows the brain scan of that same individual as they were <unk> seeing that same image.
The column on the right was created <unk> the content of the left.
This is <unk> in many different individuals with many different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between seeing a picture and imagine that same image is almost <unk>
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is from <unk> <unk> lab in Berkeley, California.
They were able to convert brain waves into the visual fields of <unk>
Let's put it in this way.
In this experiment, he showed the people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while they got rid of their brains to create a big department of reactions in the brain footage in the video.
And then they showed them a film with new images, new people, new animals, and as long as you get a new <unk>
And the computer using just the brain information you can see it to show you what it seemed like the person was seeing.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video that I showed you.
This let us <unk>
We're close to doing this.
We just need to improve the resolution.
And now, remember, when you see a picture and when you imagine that same picture, you can imagine that same picture, it creates in the brain the same <unk>
This was done with the most effective brain systems available today, and their resolution increased as a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution of a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do you do that?
There are many techniques to do it.
One is opening up the skull and introduce electrodes.
I don't offer that one.
A lot of them are proposing new techniques of projection from images, even me, <unk> with the recent result of the MRI -- we need to ask the next thing, this technology will be the end of the way the way up.
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get bigger resolution is with larger magnets -- but at this point, magnets <unk> only offered little improvements in the resolution, doesn't increase for thousands as we need.
I propose this idea: rather than of magnets larger, let's make better ones.
We can create a lot more complex structures with slightly different arrangements like making a <unk>
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a lot of effort in MRI were to do a really big magnets -- right?
However, most advances in recent advances in <unk> of clever and bright solutions on <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> radio frequency in the MRI systems.
At its time, instead of a magnetic field -- they would be able to save magnetic patterns and advanced patterns to the radio frequencies <unk>
So when we combine the magnetic patterns with the patterns of radio processing, we can dramatically increase the information that you can extract in one <unk>
In addition, we can then divide our growing knowledge into the structure of the brain and the memory to create the increase in the thousands we need.
By using <unk> we should be able to measure not only the blood fluid, but the <unk> of the hormones and <unk> that I've mentioned and perhaps even neural activity. This is sleep.
Will we be able to put our ideas into a direct form to digital media.
Can you imagine if we could go through the language and communicate directly by the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how to learn to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are great questions.
It would be <unk> used as a tool to amplify our thinking and communication skills.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to the cure of Alzheimer's and similar disease.
We have a few more options to open this door.
Anyway, you choose a year to happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine that it will take a lot more.
We need to learn how to take this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you tonight about coming out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just the same.
I think we all have <unk>
Your closet maybe tell you to some person for the first time that he loves or tell someone who's pregnant, or telling someone who has cancer, or any other difficult conversation that you have done in life.
So all directions is a hard conversation and even though our issues can vary <unk> the experience of I've lived and have come out of that closet is universal.
Day fear, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
A lot of years ago, I was working on the South Side <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city, and being there, I had to go through various phases of the intensity of <unk> <unk> <unk> my armpits, to quote the letters of <unk> gave me <unk> as a <unk>
And it's going to be <unk> that for the <unk> of my <unk> and I had <unk> my head -- I was doing a little boy, I was usually a kid -- "Hey, you're a kid or <unk>
And he would see an uncomfortable silence on the table.
I had my jaw just a little bit more, took my coffee with a leave of <unk>
The father was <unk> <unk> the newspaper and the mother launched a cold, look at his son.
But I would not say anything, and it <unk>
And I came to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised myself that the next time I would say something.
I should have that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
A family silence -- but this time I was <unk> and I was about to get away from the female issues at the table.  I had the quotes from Betty <unk>
<unk> <unk>
Even a fragment of the "Vagina Monologues," I was going to <unk>
And so I took a big breath down and I went down and I got my back a girl in four years with a little girl, looking at what is not a challenge for a feminist, <unk> <unk> just a girl with a question: "You're a kid or <unk>
So I took a deep deep deep back -- I stood up close to her, and I said, "Hey, I know this is something messy.
I have the short hair like a child, and I saw a girl, and I am a girl, and you know, as you like to wear a pink, and sometimes you like to use a <unk>
Now, I'm more from a girl in a <unk>
And that girl looked at me <unk> by paying attention, and he said, "My favorite pajamas.
Can you give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was all the stuff.
What about the <unk> that <unk>
It was the easiest thing to ever ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl in the <unk> and I, both were <unk> one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside, in the darkness, you can't know what color are the walls.
You just know how one feels living in a closet.
It's like my closet -- it's not different about yours or yours or yours.
I will give you 100 reasons why I get out of my closet it was harder to get out of his, but this is the <unk> The hard is not <unk>
The hard is hard.
Who can tell me to explain to someone who declared in banking <unk> is harder to say that it's been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I tell you is harder than saying to your five-year-old <unk>
There's no more difficult, there's only the hard thing.
We need to stop doing what is difficult to be hard about how hard for another person to make us feel better or worse in relation to our <unk> and we must only feel empathy because we all live a hard thing.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they can make them feel security, or at least more security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that it doesn't matter what your walls are made up -- a closet that's not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine yourself 20 years ago.
Me, I had a horse tail, a dress.
It was not the militant lesbian prepared to fight for any kid in four years that would fit the coffee.
I was frozen because of fear, <unk> in a corner of my dark closet <unk> my gay, and the move only a muscle is the most scary thing I've ever done.
My family, my friends, full strangers that I've spent my entire life trying not to <unk> and now the world was turning back to purpose.
I was burning the pages of a script that we've all been followed for so long, but if you don't slow that <unk> you kill you.
One of my most memorable launches was in my sister.
It was the first time that many of us were invited to know that I was gay, and by making my <unk> <unk> in my black dress and <unk> walked around the tables and finally I came to one where my friends were my parents, people who knew I was years for.
And after talking a moment, one of the women I screamed at, <unk> <unk>
And the battle of gay story had begun.
<unk> once you were in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is, we have friends in St. <unk>
"Well, we've never been there, but we've heard that it's <unk>
<unk> you know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about having <unk>
<unk> what's your favorite TV show.
Our program was Will <unk>
And you know who we would call <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but instead of trying desperately to try and try to know that I was on my side, finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses <unk> shirts,
And I had an opportunity at that moment, like all the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> could have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very difficult to find them and realize the fact that they were <unk>
And what else do you get to ask someone, but to <unk>
If you're going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing that you want.
That's how hard conversations are still without being my strong point.
Ask anyone that I would have <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I follow what I like to call the three principles of <unk>
Now, please see this through the gay perspective, but you understand that what it involves going out of any closet is essentially the same thing.
Number one: Be real.
<unk> <unk> Be yourself.
That girl in the coffee had no <unk> but I was ready for battle.
If you want someone to be <unk> the others have to know we also suffer.
Number two: Be <unk> just <unk> your <unk>
If you know they're gay, <unk>
If they say to your parents that maybe they might be gay, they will maintain the hope that that could change.
Don't give them a sense of false hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let the complex.
You communicate your truth.
It would never be done by that.
And some of you can get wounded safe, and they can get out of what they have done, but they never feel sorry for what they are.
And yes, maybe some of you will feel <unk> but that something in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not from you.
The only story that matters is that you want to write.
So the next time you find yourself in a dark closet <unk> a <unk> you must know that we've all been there before.
And you can feel very alone, but they're not.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
What is that?
If you look at the story of how intelligence, a productive example has been the famous quote from <unk> <unk> that "The question of whether a machine can think is as interesting as the question of whether a submarine can be <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a critical to the pioneers of computing as Alan <unk>
And so, a few years ago, I would take a program to try to understand the fundamental fundamental most fundamental physical mechanisms of intelligence.
Go back a step.
We first start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that they are from a alien race that you don't know about the biology of the Earth or from the Earth of the Earth, but they have incredible telescopes, and you can look at the Earth, and they have incredibly expensive lives, so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that reason is that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're from a alien race that you don't know about the intelligence of the Earth, you would see it forced to develop a physical theory that explained how to a certain point in time, the asteroids that are going to do the surface of a planet -- they stop doing it.
And so I claim this is the same question that the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that led to a number several years ago, I studied a variety of topics through science, through various disciplines, that <unk> I think, to a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there have been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be transformed carefully for the development of intelligence, and in particular, to development of universal states that <unk> the diversity of possible future.
Finally, in robotic movement, there has been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action in order to perform complex tasks.
And so, by taking all these different issues and <unk> together, I said, from a number of years ago, there is an underlying mechanism for the intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
There's only one equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent equivalent to a E = <unk> for the intelligence I've ever seen.
So what you're looking at here is a statement that intelligence is a force -- F, which acts in order to maximize future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or keeping the open choices with a force of T, with the diversity of potential future accessible, Yes, to an imminent time, <unk>
In a nutshell, the intelligence doesn't like to be <unk>
Your intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and keep the open options.
And so, having in mind this equation, is natural to ask: What can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
Do you accept the human intelligence level.
It was <unk> intelligence.
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, will show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology have suggested that universes that produce more mess, or <unk> during their life should have a tendency to more favorable conditions for intelligent beings like us.
But what if that <unk> connection between entropy and intelligence is <unk> a more <unk>
What if intelligent behavior is not only correlated with production of entropy in the long term, but it actually arises from her?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of the long-term entropy in any system where you find it.
<unk> <unk> could be able to spend multiple animal testing, play human games, and even win money <unk> actions, all of it without being told to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a <unk> human standing here we see <unk> <unk> automatically a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable partly because we never gave him a goal.
He simply decided to balance the <unk>
This ability to balance will have applications for humanoid robotics and human assistance technologies.
This ability to use tools are going to have applications in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
In addition, just like some other animals can cooperate by pulling aside from the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can do a version of the model of that task.
This ability of cooperation has interesting implications for economic and economic development and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable to a variety of <unk>
For example, here we see them successfully playing a game of <unk> against itself, <unk> their potential for play.
Here we see <unk> orchestrate new connections in a social network where friends are constantly <unk> and keeps successful <unk>
This same capacity of network network also has apps on health care, energy and intelligence.
Here we see <unk> organizing the routes of a fleet of boats, discovering success and using the Panama Canal to expand the world level from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> it is widely applicable to problems in defense and logistics and transportation.
Finally, we see <unk> spontaneously discover and running a strategy of <unk> <unk> in a simulated series of negotiation negotiation by successfully increasing assets under their exponentially.
This ability of risk management will have huge applications in finance and secure.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of human cognitive behaviors such as the use of tools, walking upright and social cooperation and social cooperation -- all flows from one equation, which leads to a system to maximize their future freedom of action.
Now, here's a deep <unk>
Let's go back to the beginning of the term -- robot, the work -- there was always the concept that if they were <unk> smart machines, there would be a <unk>
The machines are <unk> against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we have had all the concept of rebellion by the other way.
It's not that machines first become smart and then <unk> and trying to take over the world.
It's all the opposite, that the urge to take control of all possible future is a more fundamental principle than the intelligence of intelligence, the general intelligence can actually arise from taking control, rather than being backwards.
Another important consequence is the pursuit of the target.
And they often ask me, how do you look for goals to get rid of this kind of <unk>
So my equivalent to that statement to help you get the descendants to help them build artificial intelligence or to help them understand human intelligence, is this: intelligence, it must be viewed as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid constraints in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at a tipping point in human history, something between the <unk> of stars and losing the planet that we call <unk>
Although, in the last few years, we've largely expanded our knowledge of how it fits the Earth in the context of the universe.
The Kepler Kepler mission has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting other stars, which points that the Earth is only one of the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope that measures the <unk> intensity of stars when planets go through them, and they blocking a little bit of that light that they are.
The data collected by Kepler shows the sizes of the planets in addition to the distance that there are between them and their stem star.
But together, this helps us understand whether these planets are small, <unk> like the land planets in our solar system, and also the amount of light that they get from their own.
At their time, this gives clues about whether these planets that we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, while we're finding this trove of virtual worlds, our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
The year 2014 was the <unk>
<unk> and sea ice that have been with us from millennia now are disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we've caused on a global scale have driven our ability to change its course.
But I'm not a real scientist in the weather, and I'm not <unk>
But I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars, with hope to find places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You might say I'm looking for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as someone very interested in finding life in the universe can tell you that the more I look for planets like the planets like Earth, more like our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newborn planet and the planets that we know better than our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little bit further from the Sun, it can be considered a world potentially <unk> a mission like <unk>
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been <unk> in the past and part of it, that's why we study so much to Mars.
Our <unk> as the <unk> track their surface in search of clues about the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that <unk> like the <unk> mission is taking samples from the atmosphere -- and they try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
The private companies are now offered not only short space flights but also the <unk> chance of living on Mars.
But even though all of these images, they remind us to remind the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with ideas and <unk> and <unk> compared to the Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that are still <unk> places in comparison to Mars.
Even in the <unk> and most <unk> of the Earth, the air is fresh and full of oxygen <unk> by our tropical forests to thousands of miles away.
I worry that this excitement about the colonization of Mars and other planets to drag up with a big and sad <unk> the implication and the belief that Mars waiting to be out there to save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know that it's truly livable the Earth.
As much as I like exploration -- I'm deep in deep to this idea.
There's a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but say that Mars will be there to <unk> humanity is like to imagine that the captain of Titanic will comment on that <unk> really will have place in the <unk> <unk>   Thank you.
But the goals for <unk> exploration and the land preservation is not <unk>
No, it's actually faces of the same <unk> the goal to understand, to preserve and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments present in our world look like <unk> aliens.
They just find more close to home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain <unk> spaces in the hostile areas and <unk> of the ground, maybe we can satisfy the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I'm going to leave you with an experiment.
A lot of years ago, Enrico Fermi said, "Do you have to realize that our universe has existed for a long time, and we hope that there were many planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of the life of alien life until now.
Well, where are they?
Well, a possible solution to the paradox of Fermi is that when civilizations become advanced advanced enough to think about living between the stars, they lose the notion of the important thing that is to protect the origin of the planets that we will build this development.
It's arrogant to think that only colonization, <unk> will save us from ourselves, but the planetary preservation and space exploration, can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to think about the hostile environments on Mars for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the easy task to preserve <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
It was a few years ago, <unk> my own house.
And as I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that they were at the dining table, where I had <unk>
So quickly I tried to open up all the other doors and windows and all were closed.
I thought I would call a <unk> at least my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get there, and it was cold.
I could not go home from my friend of Jeff to spend night because I had an early flight to Europe to the next morning, and my <unk> and my <unk>
<unk> expensive -- but it makes no more expensive than a <unk> at a half night, so I thought, well despite the circumstances, I was very stopped.
I'm a profession a profession and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> that increases heart rhythm and <unk> levels of adrenaline and <unk>
And when I came to the counter to <unk> at the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started to ask myself, if there was something that I could do, systems that could put in your place, that would be able to put bad things out.
Or at least if bad things happen, you will make the probability that it's a total catastrophe of it.
So I started thinking about that, but until one month later, my thoughts don't <unk>
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> who had a little bit embarrassed he told him about I broke the window, and I had forgotten my passport, and Danny shared with me who had been practicing something called <unk> hindsight of it.
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written from this a few years earlier, known as the <unk>
You all know what's the <unk>
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts come and tries to figure out what went wrong right?
In the <unk> as it explains <unk> you look forward and tries to figure out all the things that could go wrong and then try to figure out what it can do to prevent things that were happening or to minimize the harm.
So what I want to talk to you about is some things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> others are not so evident.
I'm going to start with the obvious.
In the house, it <unk> a place for things that are lost very easily.
This sounds of common sense and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space memory.
There's a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to address the location of the important things, where the fish are right, where the fish are, where the fish are in the trees, where the female tribes live and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that was <unk> in the <unk> of London.
It's the part of the brain that allows the <unk> to find their nuts.
And if you ask if someone really did the experiment, they cut the <unk> sense of the <unk> and they could still find their nuts.
They were not using smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move too much, not so good for things that move a lot.
This is the reason for losing your car, <unk> <unk>
So in front of them <unk> a place for the keys, a hook on the door, maybe a plate <unk>
For your passport, a particular condition.
For your reading glasses, a particular <unk>
If you take a place and they are <unk> with it -- your stuff will always be there when the <unk>
What about the <unk>
Take with your cell phone, a picture of your credit card card, your ability to stop your mail for themselves to be in the cloud.
If these things are lost or <unk> this can facilitate <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when it's under stress, the brain releases <unk>
<unk> is toxic and <unk> the thinking.
