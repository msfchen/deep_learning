So part of <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress we won't be at the best time, and you have to put the systems on their site.
And there's perhaps not more stressful situation than when you face a medical decision.
And at some point, we're all going to be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or one to be loved to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And I'll talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> as a <unk> for all of medical decisions, and in fact for making financial decisions and social decisions and social decisions, any kind of decision that we would benefit from an rational assessment of the facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've got the result of the lab and the cholesterol result is a little bit <unk>
They all know that high cholesterol is associated with a greater risk of <unk> diseases, a heart attack.
So you're thinking that having the high cholesterol cholesterol isn't the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to give you a drug that will help reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And maybe you've heard about <unk> and you know it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today, even more likely you know people who are <unk>
So you think, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there is a question that you should do then, an statistic that you must ask for that most doctors don't want to talk, and the companies companies even less.
It's for <unk> the number we need to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
This is the number of people who have to take a drug or submit surgery in any medical procedure before you can help one person.
And you must think of what kind of statistic statistic is <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor didn't tell me something if not to help me.
But the medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not a doctor, and if it's somebody's fault of the scientists like me.
We haven't understood very well <unk> mechanisms.
But the estimates of <unk> that 90 percent of drugs works only from 30 to 50 percent of the people.
So the number needs to treat the most widely <unk> which you think it is?
How many people have to take it before it can help one person?
300.
This has the research of the cynical researchers to <unk> <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> by <unk>
I myself explored the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before they avoid a single heart attack, stroke or another <unk>
Now you might think, "Well, one chance in 300 of my <unk>
Why not, <unk> <unk> the recipe for everybody <unk>
But then you have to ask for a more statistical statistic and it is, <unk> of the effects <unk> Yes?
For this particular drug, the side effects produced in five percent of the patients.
And those include things that are <unk> <unk> muscle pain and <unk> pain -- but now they think, "The five percent is not very likely to happen to me, still taking the <unk>
But one moment.
Remember that under stress don't think clearly.
So you think about how to do this with time, so you don't have to make the chain of reasoning on the act.
300 people will take the drug, right? A person has <unk> five percent of the 300 people have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to go out of the drug that will help you the drug.
I don't say they should or don't say <unk>
I just say they must have this conversation with your doctor.
The medical ethic is part of the beginning of informed consent.
We have right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about if you want to take the risks or not.
Maybe you're thinking that I've launched this number in the air for the value of the crash, but actually this number needed to try and is quite typical.
For the surgery that gets more in the largest men in 50 percent of prostate cancer, the number we need to deal with is <unk>
That's why 49 surgeries for a person who has <unk>
And the side effects in that case is produced by 50 percent of the patients.
Those include helplessness or dysfunction -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you're lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects just <unk> a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think of time before the questions that you can argue that we will take the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all this on the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a choice many times, they want a <unk> life of pain, or a long life that could have a lot of pain to the end?
These are the things that speak and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
They can change in the heat of the moment, but at least you're trained in this kind of thought.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that time is that you get a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
Face on face with a predator -- you don't need the <unk> system or the <unk> or the immune system, because if your body is spending the metabolism on those things, it's not going to be very quickly. They might be able to get lunch lunch so none of that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those moments of stress is the rational logical thought, like Danny <unk> and his colleagues have been shown.
So we need to be able to think about the future to this kind of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we're all <unk>
We are all going to fail at time.
The idea is to think about the future how they could be those <unk> to put the systems in the place that will help minimize damage, or to prevent the bad things in the first place.
<unk> at the night of <unk> in <unk> when I came back from my journey, my contractor installed a combination of combination along the door, with a key to the gate in the same way, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have a lot of cards that I haven't <unk> and lots of messages that I've never read about.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization as a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: So <unk> is my favorite music.
It means <unk> <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument, and you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to play <unk>
Two <unk> even more gentle.
Four <unk> <unk>
This is my drawing of a tree of <unk> you see that it doesn't matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> can be, I will never get a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the story of the American American system, the <unk> in addition to a little bit of my own story.
The language of French signs came over over the past decade, and over the time of time, it gets mixed with local signs, and developed the language we know today as <unk>
So, it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> and I was taught to believe that sound was not a part of my life.
And I believed it was true.
However, I realize that it's not true for anything.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, are really in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a sound world, is as if I lived in a foreign country, following blind their rules, <unk> behaviors and norms without <unk>
So how do I understand the sound?
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my speakers and <unk> the sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people <unk>
So I've learned, for example ...
"Don't <unk> <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise to eat a bag of potato chips.
"Not <unk> and when you're eating, make sure you don't get the <unk> in the <unk>
So I call it <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think about the sound tag more than the average person does it.
I'm super <unk> of sounds.
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound, which is about coming next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk> decide.
<unk> to go on.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see the <unk> has no notes in the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through the <unk> subtle and <unk>
In <unk> culture, the movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal for <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, to me, do the self with my thumb -- it's not a lot of nature.
That's why I just have four lines on the paper.
In 2008, I had a chance to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic residence there.
Before this time, I had worked as a <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and spaces of different <unk> and as I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that moment, the sound was the trend and that called me the <unk>
There was no visual art.
Now sound has entered my territory of art.
Is it going to be <unk> more of art?
I realized it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that it doesn't only experience through the ears.
I can feel it <unk> or that experience visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the property of sound and <unk> in my artistic practice.
And everything I had taught me at the sound of sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I introduced it to the art community, I was shocked by the amount of support and attention I got.
I realized that sound is like money, power, the <unk> social currency.
In the background of my mind, I always felt that the sound was <unk> it was something that was <unk>
And the sound is so powerful that I could do it for me and my artistic work, or I could be <unk>
I chose that I was going to ask me.
There's a massive culture around speech language.
And only because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, to the eyes of society is like if I had no voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me like and become my voice.
So I am able to be relevant in today's society.
So in school, in the work, and the institutions, work with many different performers from <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, by asking you to get your voices, I'm able to maintain a temporary form of value something like taking a loan with a very high interest rate.
If you're not going to continue with this practice, I feel that I could be able to get it into the forget and not have any kind of social value.
So with sound like my new artistic medium <unk> in the world of music.
And I was amazed by seeing the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note cannot capture and express fully on paper.
And the same can be said about a concept in <unk>
The two are very space and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all of the significance of the signals like the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a piece of the piano, so you understand better how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
<unk> is split in a lot of different <unk>
If you translate a different <unk> for each finger while you touch the piano, like facial expression, the shape of the body, the shape of the hand, and the shape of your hand, as you touch the piano, English is a linear language, as if you were <unk> only one key at the time.
However, the <unk> is more like a <unk> you need the 10 fingers in order to express a clear concept, or an idea in <unk>
If only one key would change in it, it would create a completely different meaning.
Same thing happens with music in terms of the <unk> <unk> and volume.
In <unk> by using these different parameters -- they can express different ideas.
So for example, the signal <unk> in that."
This is the signal <unk> in that."
I'm looking at.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, I <unk>
<unk> oh.
What are you <unk>
Oh, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I look at <unk> through the <unk>
If I had to create a sign and take it over and over again, it could be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the sign of the <unk> the sun comes out and you watch.
This is all day."
If you put it on, and you shake the visually speed, the visually sees as a piece of music.
All day.
I feel that the same thing can say about <unk> <unk>
"All the <unk>
This is all night, in this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk>
I feel that the third has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents how time is expressed in <unk> and how the distance to the body can express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> it's two hands, the present one makes it closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
Then, <unk> <unk> <unk> and last one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic and dramatic idea at the same time, let's save it again."
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific rate of <unk>
But when I see the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically in <unk> at the same time."
Look at <unk> right, <unk> left hand.
We have the <unk> through the head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Can you do with me?
All of your hands with your hands.
Now we're going to do it as much in my head like chest, something like <unk> <unk> or <unk> at the same time."
Yes, very well.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and language languages around the world.
The second one I'd like to show you is this. Please do it again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, the third one, please. <unk> again.
And again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
We're going to do the three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
Notice how three signs are very similar. They all happen in the head and the chest. But they transmit very different meanings now.
It's amazing to see how the <unk> is alive and thriving as the music.
However, today, we live in a very <unk> world.
And just because the <unk> has no sound automatically doesn't have social value.
We need to start questioning what defines social value and allow the <unk> to develop their own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more <unk> society.
And maybe people will understand that you don't have to be deaf to learn <unk> You don't have to hear to learn music.
<unk> is a rich trove of trove and I'd like it to have the same experience.
I'd like to show you your ears, open your eyes to participate in our culture and experience our visual language.
And you never know it can be fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents would say, "You can <unk> everything, but then you have to <unk>
Freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination led me to all these wonderful places where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a bubble of innocence or a bubble of ignorance -- I should say, because adults would lie to us to protect us from the awful truth.
When I get older, I learned that adults also <unk> and that they're not very good at cleaning the other people.
The country, now I'm an adult and teaching citizen and invention in <unk> <unk>
You don't have to wait a lot for my students to walk on the beach with lots of garbage.
So as good citizens, cleaned up <unk> and no, they're not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't get it.
It's sad to say, but more than 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's kind of scary.
And in the last few decades, we have been coming out with these big ships and networks, to collect those pieces of plastic to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it lasts for an eternity and it's very expensive and it's very risky to use those huge <unk>
So along with my students, with ages six to 15 years, we dream about inventing a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We began to build this <unk> job <unk> so that the kids are very <unk> they can also participate.
And I'll tell you the kids who are providing electrical tools they feel great, and secure.
Exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect the plastic and reduce it to the size we find it in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
So we do.
I leave it to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to figure out something that we hope to work.
We decided that instead of collecting pieces of plastic, just <unk> information.
Through using a robot, we took a picture of this <unk> the children will get a lot with the robots.
Then we started what we call "a <unk>
We are so fast in creating prototypes that we ended up before lunch.
And we can transform the lights and web cameras on accessories.
We see pieces of plastic floating slowly through the sensor while the computer on board to process this image and measure the size of each <unk> to get an estimate of how much plastic in the water.
I took this invention step into a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone would get it even more.
The great thing about this project is that the students saw a local problem, and <unk> are trying to fix it immediately.
I'm able to investigate my problem -- but my students in Hong Kong are very good kids.
You see the news news, <unk> the Internet, and you get rid of this one.
A child, maybe less than 10 years, cleaning up a oil spill, just using the hands, in <unk> the world's largest forest in Bangladesh.
They were very surprised because this is the water that <unk> is the water that <unk> the water where the place they live.
You can also see that the water is brown and the oil and the oil are the brown color, and when it's <unk> it's very hard to see what in the water.
But there is a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
So we built a very first prototype of a <unk> that can be addressed through all kinds of substances that produce <unk> which can help identify what's in the water.
We would take this prototype with a sensor and we send him to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help the other child to help other children.
I could investigate a problem with <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little further away and I wanted to go a little further, and I wanted to go closer to me.
I'm half Japanese and French half and maybe remember, that in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that triggered several giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> destroy various cities on the coast of Japan.
More than 14,000 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear energy plant from Fukushima, a nuclear nuclear station close to water.
And today, according to the reports of 300 tons are still leaking from the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, the whole Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution by <unk>
If we go to the west coast, we can measure the radiation of <unk> everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast of the Japanese coast -- and the most of the time, it has <unk> it's blue.
Well, it's a little bit more complicated than that.
I've come back to <unk> every year from the crash and making independently with other scientists, the ground, the river, and we wanted to take the children.
Of course not the <unk> the parents don't know it.
But every night I went to the center of <unk> here you see use of different masks here.
It might seem that they didn't seem to do serious work, but they did it because they're going to have to live with the <unk> all his life.
Along with them we discussed the data, that day, and we talk about what we were going to do later, the strategies, the <unk> and so on.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the plant of nuclear power.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> tones to represent real time from <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
We were able to notice that the radioactive dust <unk> from the top of the mountain to the <unk> system and <unk> in the ocean.
It was a <unk> <unk>
But based on this, we organized a civil expedition -- the nearest central expedition to date.
We get up to 1.5 miles of nuclear use, and with the <unk> aid of the area we were collecting sediments from the sea floor with a <unk> <unk> as we invented and we built.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem.
And it has been very exciting to work on these different scales and also with very simple source technologies.
But at the same time, it's been increasingly frustrating because we've only been beginning to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve the problems.
I wonder if we should give the leap and try to invent better ways to do all these things.
So the classroom became a little bit so small so we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and we converted it into the largest space dedicated to social and environmental impact.
It's in the center of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with <unk> metal, chemistry a little bit of biology, basically, you can build almost all there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can become reality with adults, and where adults can be children again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> asked things like, can we invent the future of mobility by energy <unk>
For example.
Or can we help in mobility from the current age, transforming their standard wheels in new self-driving cars.
The plastic, oil and <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our children are lies.
We cannot afford to protect the children of the awful truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
And so, as many scientists, creators, <unk> we must make the next generation for the environment and people, and so that I can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two cultures of radically opposite design.
One is made from thousands of steel parts, the other one silk silk silk.
One of them is synthetic -- the other organic.
One goes on the environment, the other thing happened to it.
One is designed by nature, the other for it.
Michelangelo said that when he looked at the default, he saw a figure that fight for being free.
The <unk> was only a tool for Michelangelo.
But living beings are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, cells, cells, we carry all the information required for every cell to work and to <unk>
The tools also have consequences.
At least since the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by manufacturing and production of production in mass.
The assembly lines have dictated a world made out of parts, <unk> the imagination of designers and architects trained to think of their objects as <unk> from different parts with different functions.
But you don't find <unk> material in nature.
Think of the human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with light-activated pore.
The skins of the back are more thick with little <unk>
You acts primarily like <unk> the other mainly as a barrier, and yet it's the same <unk> there's no <unk>
It's a system that changes gradually its functionality through variation in <unk>
Here's a split screen, which represents my view of the world -- <unk> the personality of every designer and architect in working currently between the <unk> and the gene, between the machine and the organism, between the assembly and the growth, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right, and a good one, is shown in the two screens after me.
My work, in the most simple level, tries to unite these two visions of the world, away from the assembly and getting to growth.
You probably ask yourself, why now?
Why wasn't this 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a strange moment, where they have four disciplines that offers designers to access the tools we had never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create.
Please know the minds and my hands of my students.
We design objects, products, products, structures and tools through the scale of a very scale of 24 meters like this robotic arm that would someday be able to print <unk> buildings and graphics on the nanoscale made out of genetically genetically <unk> <unk> in the dark.
Here we have <unk> the <unk> a archetype of the ancient Arab architecture -- and it's created a screen where every aperture is only size to shape the form of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explore the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> and this was for a fashion fashion fashion fashion with <unk> they're <unk> It's like a second skin made from one piece, <unk> in the flexible <unk> around the waist.
Along with 3D printing or 3D printing -- we printed this layer and 3D skirt without seams between cells. I'll show you more objects like that.
This helmet combines rigid materials and <unk> in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a <unk> scanner.
That designers have access to this high-tech analytical and the <unk> instruments that are allowed to design products that are <unk> not only the shape of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We've also designed a acoustic chair, which is a very comfortable chair.
The Carter professor, my collaborator, went back to nature to <unk> and to design this pattern of <unk> it becomes <unk>
So let's take this surface of 44 different properties, which vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> the points of pressure in the human body.
Their surface, as in nature, varies its functionality not by addition to other material or another <unk> but <unk> continually <unk> and <unk>
But it's nature <unk>
There are no parts in nature?
I didn't grew up in a religious home, but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories of the Bible <unk> and one of them came up and got to define a lot of what I care about.
As she said, "In the third day of <unk> God sends the Earth to grow a <unk> tree <unk>
For that first tree that <unk> there was no difference between <unk> branches, leaves and <unk>
The whole tree was a fruit.
Instead, the land made up trees with branches, <unk> <unk> and flowers.
The earth created a world made of parts.
I often ask myself, "What is the design if the objects were made by a single part?
<unk> a better state of <unk>
So we look for the material that <unk> the kind of material of the <unk> tree with fruit and we found it.
The second <unk> more abundant on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons of tons of organisms produce every year for organisms like shrimp, <unk> <unk> and <unk>
We think that if we could tune into their properties, we could generate structures that were built on one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it legal <unk>  We asked a bunch of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> natural concentrations have been able to achieve a wide range of properties, from dark, hard and <unk> to the light, smooth and transparent.
To print the <unk> structures that built a system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could vary the properties of the material on the march and create these structures made from a single new material, a long, 100 percent recycled.
When the pieces are lists, it stops it to dry them to find a natural way in the air with the air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the process of printing were used to contain <unk> <unk> that first appeared on the planet three billion years ago, like we heard yesterday.
Along with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> bacteria designed genetically to capture rapidly carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we have been able to generate structures that make their transition without problems of <unk> to mesh, and if it spread even more, to windows.
A <unk> tree <unk>
Working with a ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and with a bit of synthetic biology, we've transformed a structure of <unk> of shrimp <unk> into an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here is the best <unk> for <unk> designed in the sea, <unk> life and placed on the ground, help grow a tree.
The fit for our next exploration using the same principles of design was the solar system.
We're looking for the possibility of creating clothes to maintain life for <unk>
To do that, we must dominate bacteria and control their flow.
Just like the <unk> table, we made our own <unk> <unk> new forms of life created <unk> made <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think about synthetic biology, like liquid <unk> only that instead of <unk> metals that are <unk> new biological basic in very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
We have our own 3D channels to control the flow of these <unk> crops.
In our first piece of clothes, you know, two microorganisms.
The first is <unk>
It lives in our oceans and in the <unk> of fresh water.
And the second, E. <unk> the bacteria that <unk> in the human intestine in the human gut of it.
One turns the light into sugar, the other consumes sugar and produces useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two microorganisms, don't interact in nature.
In fact, they never <unk>
They are here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution by design.
In order to contain these relationships, we've created a single channel that looks like the <unk> tract.
So we started to grow those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of the material according to the functionality <unk>
If we wanted to make more <unk> channels more transparent channels.
This gut system is <unk> when it stretches from one end to another, 60 meters.
This is half the length of a football field, and 10 times more than our gut <unk>
And here it is, like <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> channels with life within your clothing.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> he said, "We are <unk> creatures -- only half is <unk>
What if design would provide the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase the <unk>
And if we could create personal <unk> that <unk> our skin, they have harmed and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a way of editing biology.
I call this the material ecology.
To do that, you always have to go back to nature.
So now, you know that a 3D printer is printing on layers.
You also know that nature doesn't do that.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture of a home within which it was <unk>
<unk> manufacturing is about this level of <unk>
It makes it through combination of not two materials, but of two proteins in different <unk>
One acts as structure, the other one is the glue or the matrix, <unk> those fibers each other.
And this is going through scales.
The silk worm first turned into the environment, creates a structure of tension, and then it starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and the <unk> the two forces in life, they manifest themselves in a single material.
In order to understand better how this complex process works, we attach a small magnet to the head of a silk worm to the <unk>
We put it into a box with magnetic sensors and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the cocoon of the cocoon of the silk worm.
And yet, when you put the silk worm into a flat patch -- not within a box, we realized that they <unk> a flat cocoon and still <unk> <unk>
So we started to design different parts of different parts, and we've discovered that the way, the composition, the structure of the <unk> are transmitted directly by the environment.
They often get rid of silk worms to death within their <unk> its silk <unk> and it uses in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these templates we could shape the raw silk without boiling a single <unk>
It <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we climb this process to the architectural scale.
We had a robot <unk> making <unk> and you put it in our site.
We knew the worms of silk <unk> to more dark areas and <unk> so we use a solar route to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we create holes or <unk> to block the rays of light and heat into the light worms on the structure.
We were ready to get <unk>
We were asking to <unk> silk worms to a online <unk>
And after <unk> four weeks, they were ready to engage with us.
We put them carefully on the lower edge of the <unk> and as they were <unk> <unk> they were going to put eggs, and life starts again, like us, but much, much more short.
<unk> Fuller said that tension is great integrity, and he was right.
<unk> biological silk on <unk> <unk> <unk> they give all this pavilion your integrity.
And in a little bit more than two or three weeks, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the path of silk.
<unk> after <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A silk <unk> through a robotic arm, the other full gaps.
If the latest frontier of design is to give you life to products and the buildings that surround us to form an ecology of two materials, designers must bring these two visions in the world.
Which brings us back, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new era of design, a new era of creation, which brings us from a design inspired by the nature of an inspired nature of design, which requires us, for the first time, that we do in charge of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Hands up if you've ever asked, "What do you want to be from <unk>
If you had to remember how old they had when they asked them for the first time.
They can do it with your fingers.
Three. Five.
Now, raise your hand if you ask yourself, "What do you want to be from <unk>
They have caused them some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be from <unk>
The problem was not that I had no interest, but I had <unk>
In school I liked the English, the <unk> and the art and the art and the website, and he started the guitar on a rubber band called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard about us.
And generally I like to test and persist anyway, for having spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But with time this sense of <unk> this feeling of, this is no longer a challenge, comes to <unk>
And I have to go on.
But then I'm going to tell me about something else, which is totally different, and I'm going to tell me about it, and I let myself absorb and I feel <unk> I've found it <unk> and then again, this point where I start <unk>
And finally, I want to take it back.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn this whole thing into a career.
I thought I had to choose a thing, to deny all of my own passions, and we would get to <unk>
Another reason that caused me so much anxiety was a little more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something wrong with me not <unk> at all.
I was concerned to be afraid of commitment, or whether to be a <unk> or <unk> or my own success.
If you can relate to my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something that I'd like to have asked me back then.
<unk> themselves, where do they learn to allocate the meaning of bad or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where they did, they learned from culture.
We ask ourselves, "What do you want to be from <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what you're going to do?"
It's considered a naive question to cause cute answers in kids like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> or want to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> here.
This question is done again and again as we grow in various ways as we are growing in a bunch of ways -- they will be asked to get to school students are asked to pick up in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be from <unk>
It happens to be the cute exercise before what the dream.
Why?
If this question is inspired by kids to dream with what might be, not inspire dreaming of anything that might be.
In fact, it does exactly the opposite, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't respond to 20 different things, even though healthy adults might be <unk> and say, "Oh, what cute, but you can't be <unk> and <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  and he's <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And this <unk> <unk> editor of magazine turned into <unk> <unk> teacher and creative office.
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is that they will have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or real <unk> the idea that each of us has something to do for their time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is and devote your life to it.
But if you're someone who's not connected in this way?
What if there are a lot of different issues that wake up their curiosity and lots of different things that wants to do?
There's no place for someone like one in that framework.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that you don't have a goal.
And you feel like there's something wrong with one.
There's nothing wrong in you.
You are a <unk>
A <unk> is someone with many interests and creative activities.
It's a breath so to say.
It could help you divide in three parts: multiple potential and <unk>
You can also use other terms that you can use the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the age of the Renaissance, the ideal was the one who was okay with multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
<unk> any term that you like or you might be <unk>
It seems to me as a kind of adapt to a community, we cannot agree with one of a single identity.
It's easy to see <unk> like limitation or <unk> you must win.
But what I've learned about talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths in this way.
Here's three superpowers <unk>
One, the synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and the creation of something new in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> his shared interests in cartography, visualizing and design and design, when I found <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates <unk> <unk>
<unk> and Rachel came up with this unique idea by its <unk> mix of skills and experiences.
The innovation happens at the intersections.
So the new ideas.
And the <unk> with all of their traditions, can access a lot of these points of <unk>
The second superpower <unk> is fast learning.
When we were <unk> we are interested in it, let's do it.
We look at everything that we can have in our hands.
We're used to being <unk> because it was many times in the past, and this means we have less afraid of testing new things and coming out of our zones of comfort.
A lot of skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring all the things that we've learned to each new area that we have so rarely started from zero.
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> at full time and a <unk>
As a girl girl, an amazing ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest <unk>
Before he turned into a writer, I was <unk> financial <unk>
He had to learn the most fine sales mechanics when they started their own, and this ability helps to write compelling marks for the editors.
It's <unk> a loss of time to have a loss of time to do what you would tell you, even if you end the end of it.
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a totally different field in a way that you couldn't have <unk>
The third superpower, <unk> is adaptability.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes the director of videos, and the web designer designer, sometimes a website, sometimes master, and sometimes, it turns out, James <unk>
It's valuable because it makes a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take diverse <unk> depending on the needs of your customers.
<unk> magazine defined adaptability as the most important ability for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so quickly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can be able to deal with the market needs of the market for the market needs.
<unk> of ideas, fast learning and <unk> three skills where <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that could be lost if they're a pressure to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest in encouraging the <unk> to be themselves.
We have complex problems, <unk> right now, and we need creative thinkers to deal with them.
Let's say they are, in your heart <unk>
They got rid of the belly knowing because they wanted to be <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you either.
In fact, some of the best teams made up of a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The acoustician can dive deep and put into ideas, and the <unk> offers a amplitude of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all be designing lives and careers that are dealing with the way we're connected.
And unfortunately, the <unk> in great part are <unk> to just be more like their fellow <unk>
Once that, if there's one thing you take from this talk, I hope that it's this: <unk> with the internal wiring whatever it is.
If you are a heart specialist -- then, <unk> for all media.
That's where you will give you the best of it.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who just saw being one of them in the last 12 minutes --  I say, <unk> with your many passions.
Keep his curiosity for those <unk> <unk>
<unk> the intersections.
<unk> our inner wiring leads to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most importantly, <unk> the world are <unk>
Thank you.
In <unk> a woman called <unk> they took a psychiatric psychiatric failure.
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of his life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her until unfortunately, passed away in <unk>
After his death, <unk> he did a <unk> and they found weird <unk> and they found <unk> in the <unk> brain, of a guy who had never seen before.
What's even more surprising.
If I was living -- I would have been living today, we couldn't give it to her more help than he <unk> he gave him <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to receive a diagnosis we now call Alzheimer's disease.
From <unk> medicine has come a lot.
We've discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from <unk> many treatments for cancer -- a lot of treatments for cancer, <unk> for <unk> and much more.
But it has been successful in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
I'm part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's to more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million around the world.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million -- by the way, to include many of you.
If you expect to live up to 85 years or more, the chance to get Alzheimer's to be almost one of each two.
In other words, there is the probability that they go through their years with Alzheimer's or helping to take care of a friend or wanted Alzheimer's disease.
Because only in America, Alzheimer's dollars costs 200,000 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of healthcare dollars is spent on Alzheimer's disease.
Today it's the most expensive disease and its costs -- an increase in five times in 2050, by 2050, as the generation of the <unk> boom.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the biggest doctors and social challenges of our generation.
But it's been relatively little done to <unk>
Today, one of the top 10 causes of death across the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that cannot be <unk> to cure or even slow their development.
We understand less than Alzheimer's than other diseases because we've invested less time and money in the same thing.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in the cancer research in spite of the fact that the fact that it costs us more Alzheimer's and causes a half similar numbers of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what little people know about, but everybody else -- Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last few years, all of us -- even scientists, <unk> Alzheimer's with aging.
We think that will be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But you only have to look at a picture of a heart of a healthy brain compared to the one of a Alzheimer's patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to making a severe memory loss and mental skills, the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's reduces the life expectancy and is always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found plates and <unk> strangers in the brain of <unk> a century.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
We now know that they're made of protein molecules today.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that folds as an origami.
There are places in the paper that are <unk>
And when it folds up, these <unk> dots end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some <unk> dots are on the outside.
This makes the molecules in the protein <unk> each other forming groups that can form large plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There's a lot of steps, and the identification of which step is complex, like <unk> a bomb.
You put a wire could do nothing.
<unk> others can make the bomb <unk>
You have to find the right step that we did, and then create a drug that it does.
Until recently, in its most part of the wires have been reduced and expected the best.
But now there's a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, <unk> chemicals, physical, engineers, and mathematicians.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. Now it's testing a new kind of drugs that generally accurately this step to stop the disease.
Let me show you some of our latest results.
No one outside of our lab has seen it yet.
Let's see a few videos of what happened to the test these drugs in <unk>
These are the clean worms and you can see that they move normally.
These worms on the other hand, have protein molecules that stick with each other within them, as humans with Alzheimer's disease.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But by giving our new drugs to these worms in an early stage, then we see that <unk> and live a normal life.
This is just a good initial outcome, but research like this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years, there are real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But in order to get that hope, to overcome Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to argue that Alzheimer's is a disease and that if we fix it, we can <unk>
In the case of other disease, patients and their families have <unk> more research and <unk> pressure on governments, drug industry and <unk>
That was essential to move away from HIV to the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to overcome cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk to themselves.
And their families, the hidden hidden victims of their loved ones day and night, they're often too <unk> to get out and advocate for change.
So, it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not in most cases a genetic disease.
Everyone with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> that cannot create the change they need for themselves.
They were talking about them, and they will help demand a cure.
Thank you.
We had this article in the neocortical column in the New York Times, in January of this year.
To fall in love with somebody, do this.
The paper is about a psychological study designed to create romantic love in the lab, and my own experience to test it as a night last night.
So the procedure is quite simple: Two strangers are <unk> to make 36 questions more and more personal questions, and then both look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple questions for example.
Number one: If you could wake up with an quality or skill, which would be?
Number two: When was it the last time you would get someone else's <unk>
And <unk>
<unk> are getting more and more personal <unk>
Number two: <unk> really <unk> me to your partner what like him or it or it, I know very truthful this time, and I gave things that you don't say to someone you've ever met.
When I stumbled across this study a few years ago, a detail really struck me -- the gadget two of the participants had married six months later, and invited all the lab to the <unk>
So, it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, I was also <unk>
And when I had a chance to test this study, with someone I knew not particularly well, I didn't expect to <unk>
However, we got it up, and  And I thought it was a good story, so I'll send it to the spinal column, a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already <unk> so I guess some of you are probably asking, they still keep still going together.
And the reason I think is to challenge this is because they've done this question over and over the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to the subject.
One week before the paper was <unk> was so nervous.
I had been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I had taught me to write about my experience in romantic love on my blog.
But a blog input can get to a few hundred views as a lot, and those were usually just my Facebook friends and imagined that my article in the New York Times would probably have a few thousand of those.
And that came up with a good burden of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But I had no idea.
The paper was published on a Friday night, and then I Saturday, this happened in the traffic of my blog.
And the Sunday, I had been called the "Today Show and "Good <unk> <unk>
In a month, the paper received over eight million pages, and I was, by saying something, a little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster confidence in writing with <unk> experiences, but another thing is to discover that the loving life of one has been international news --  and the people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people called it or write what they did every day for weeks, they did the same question: still still together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick search on the mailbox of my email with the phrase: <unk> <unk>
And so many messages appear immediately.
They were students and journalists and strange <unk> like this.
I was interviewed on radio and <unk>
Even, I gave a talk, and a woman yelled up to the stage, "Hey <unk> where your <unk>
And I immediately got red.
I understand that this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in a international newspaper, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I was not prepared for the wingspan of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to have <unk> their own.
In fact, the New York Times published an article called <unk> <unk> which included the experiences of readers to test the study in them with different degrees of success.
So my first urge to all this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to every petition that we both did a public emergence together.
And I was able to TV interviews, and I <unk> the photos of us two.
I think it was afraid that I was afraid of becoming the <unk> icons of the process of <unk> a range for which I didn't feel at all the <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know only if the study worked work, they wanted to know if it was able to make love to be able to produce love -- not just an adventure, but a real love love -- love <unk>
But this was a question I didn't feel able to respond.
My relationship was just a few months, and I felt, especially that people posed the wrong question.
How do you know if you were to do it together or not, and also <unk>
If the answer was no, I would make the experience of doing these 36 questions less interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this exact same study in 1997. And there the researcher goal was not to produce romantic love.
Instead of that, I was looking for interpersonal <unk> between university students, using what <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Sounds romantic, right?
But the study did work.
The participants felt closer after doing that -- several research studies, they also used <unk> protocol -- they were used by a rapid way to create trust and interaction between strangers.
They have used them between members of the police and the community, and they used it among people from the opposite political <unk>
The original version of the story, which I tried last summer, that combines personal questions with four minutes of visual contact, was cited in this paper, but unfortunately never published it.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk at a little liberal arts university, and then a student came up to me and told me with <unk> <unk> the studio and didn't work.
He seemed <unk> for it.
And I said, "Do you want to say that you would tell you about the person who you do it.
Well he made a program.
I think she just wants us to be friends.
And I said, but they became better friends?
<unk> that they had to get better after testing the <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it comes to love.
I stumbled across the study for the first time when I was 29 and I was going through a really difficult <unk>
I had had this relationship since I had 20, what I was supposed to most of my adult life, and he was my first real love, and I had no idea how or if I could live without it.
So I went to the science.
And I did all that I could find about romantic love, and I was hoping that it could actually be a kind of <unk> <unk>
I don't know if I realized this at the moment, I thought I was just talking to the book that I wrote but in retrospect, it seems really <unk>
I thought that if I was reminded of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad and used as I sat then.
And all this knowledge has been useful in one way or another.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence in demand what I'm after.
But I can also see me more clearly and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than reasonably can demand me.
What I'm looking for from love is an impossibility. Not just to be <unk> today and being <unk> tomorrow, but I'm going to continue to be <unk> everywhere I love.
It may be that this is the guarantee that people wonder when they wanted to know if they were still together.
The story that they told the media about the 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way for some ways to mitigate something of the risk -- and this is a very <unk> story, because in love makes us feel beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The story of the story that says, still follow together?
And the content with an answer of Yes or No.
So more than a question, I would argue that let's make more difficult questions, questions like, how do you decide who deserves your love and who isn't it?
How do you stay in love when things are <unk> and how to know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably leads to one relationship? Or how you live with the doubt of your mate?
I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a more <unk> conversation about what it means to love someone.
So if you want the short version of the history of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, a known one, and we applied a study designed to create romantic love, we are still following together, and I'm very <unk>
But in love -- it's not the same thing that remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my <unk> <unk> love didn't happen.
<unk> fell in love because we took the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit by reading this now, not because in the moment, it was not true, but because at the time, there was no whole thing that I was supposed to do.
I didn't think, how many times would we have both to make that decision, and how much it will have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he would always choose or not.
I want you to be enough to have done that and answer 36 questions, we have chosen to love someone so generous, kind of fun, and I have expressed that choice in the largest newspaper in the United States.
But what I've done, instead, is to turn my relationship to the kind of myth that I don't really believe.
And what we <unk> and what I might spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the happy ending implicit in the title of my paper -- which is, by the way, the only part of the article that I didn't really wrote.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to love someone, and the hope that he also love, and it's scary, but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by a little lesbian in full mountain and in a way I got a <unk> of the forest.
A time ago, New York makes a while,  -- something that really affected me but more details later on.
I will start with when I was eight years old.
I took a box of wood, and I took a ticket for a dollar, a pen and a fork in it somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought that some strange <unk> or aliens find this box about 500 years later, and <unk> how our species <unk> ideas, for example how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it's very grace because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still making boxes.
At a moment, because I was in <unk> <unk> like to go from walking and <unk> and all of those <unk> things, and I was doing a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took all the pages and I took all the pages and I made a kind of <unk> <unk> a <unk> I wrapped the <unk> and a bee got <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of bees and it's <unk> to them, so I added more resin on the canvas, thinking that I could <unk>
Instead, it happened to the opposite: it somehow seemed to be growing up size, as if it was that they were doing the text with a <unk>
So I did? I built more boxes.
This time, I started to add the electronic elements, weird bottles that I was finding out of the street, all I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to figure out and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around objects, and I realized that God of mine can draw in space.
I can flow <unk> drawing just like you do about a body on the crime scene.
And I picked up the objects and created my own taxonomy of specimens and <unk>
First of all, I want you to be able to get an idea.
Then I made these little insects and strangers.
It was very fun to draw in the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was making some money, to bring my girlfriend for dinner, for example, going to <unk>
It was <unk> man.
At some point I got interested in the human form -- sculptures of natural sizes with drawings of human beings inside the layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I was shocked.
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the glass sheets, similar to drawing on a window and then another window and another window, and I had all these windows together that were a three-dimensional composition together.
And this really works, and so I could stop using <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work was going to be very big, I call <unk>
For <unk> I was inspired by a great measure in "The <unk> of <unk> <unk> which is a painting in the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
You know?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little bit ahead of your time.
Well, <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11 pounds.
<unk> feet long.
It has double face, so it's 10 meters of composition.
It's a little bit weird.
Well, that's the blood source.
On the left, it's Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all of these creatures with animals are moving between two worlds.
They are the world of <unk> to this <unk> <unk> where they were <unk>
This is where creatures with animals are run by <unk> lists for suicide <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a bird god tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform of the <unk> <unk> the shelter of Osama Bin Laden, there are all kinds of weird things that you can find if you look very well in the ocean.
Anyway, also a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in a hand while the other hand is going to be clouds.
Their hands are like <unk> and it looks like a <unk> that keeps the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's one aspect of the <unk>
It's a little bit of a narrative.
That's the hand in which I <unk>
And then, when you go on the other hand, it has a bird, like a bird, and it spits out this <unk>
It also has a <unk> tail, over a snake tail that joins the <unk>
Anyway, your tail is <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things that go up, you know.
His tail ends up in an eye of <unk> made from terrorists from 1986.
They've got them.
They were made in the 1980s, as if they were a baseball cards of terrorists.
Very <unk> at their time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a <unk> project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each of us is a archive of our culture, through media and material to be <unk> dictionaries or magazines.
But each one acts as a kind of file in a form of being human, and they travel in groups, four or 12 at a time.
They're like cells, they come together, they <unk>
And you can walk between them. I'm getting years.
Each one is basically a microscope <unk> that weighs 1.3 kilos with a human trapped inside.
This is a little cave on the chest.
That's the <unk> he's the chest and the <unk>
I'm going to take you through the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall coming out of her chest, and he covers the penis or the <unk> or whatever you have, a kind of <unk> thing.
This is a quick review of these works because I can't do it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a body in half.
This has two heads -- and it's communicating between the two.
There are some pills that come out and come into the head of this strange statue there.
There's a little forest scene inside the <unk>
They can <unk>
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> just like the boxes that we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick box. It's called <unk> <unk>
Within this box there is a physicist, a neuroscientist, a musician, a musician, a musician, a musician, a writer, a school, an editorial arm that spreads all the content we do in the world, and a garden.
<unk> the box and all the people inside hits each other as particles.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When you <unk> who is and the box is living on.
And together we get to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of the countries, of the <unk> of religion, does not work.
We're all very made of the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start to exchange those things with sweetness and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do they do when your head?
They take a <unk>
But for this pill that this pill has to be against pain, first goes through the stomach, the guts and other organs.
And I'm going to take a pill that is the most effective system and <unk> so that any drug will be made in the body.
<unk> though, is that the <unk> any drug is <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in patients with HIV.
When they take <unk> drugs they serve to decrease the amount of viruses in the blood, and increase the iPhone cells.
But they are also known for their side side effects in its most negative, because in the time that it takes to get to the top of your blood current <unk> and worse even for the time that it takes to get to their destiny, which is where it's most important, in the warehouse of HIV.
These are regions of the body like the metastatic <unk> the nervous system, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't easily go into the blood stream of patients that are being used to a regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after the disruption of treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new cells.
This is the great problem of treatment with HIV treatment with the current drugs that is a treatment of life treatment is <unk>
One day, I sat down and I thought, "I will get the treatment directly to the virus, without the risk of <unk> of <unk>
As a scientist in <unk> the answer was in front of me: <unk> of course.
If you use it in <unk> for the wounds of wounds and surgery and diabetes surgery can be used for anything <unk> including effective drug transportation.
In fact, we are already using pockets of laser to open or drill extremely small, <unk> holes that open and close and close it almost cells infected with HIV to introduce drugs.
You best ask, "How is that <unk>
We sent a little powerful little beam laser beam on the cellular membrane with HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser through the cell, while the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of microseconds.
Before even realizing the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro or <unk> <unk> but the goal is to take this technology to the human body, apply it to the human body.
"How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is: through a three heads.
With the first head, which is our laser, we'll make a <unk> on the site of infection.
The second head, which is a camera, and it moves to the site of infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> that distributes it directly into the location of infection, whereas the laser is used again to keep the cells open.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if you're successful, this technology can lead to the total total of HIV of the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the <unk> dream of <unk> in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've been studying armed groups not <unk> the armed organizations like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
<unk> what these groups do when they're not shoot up.
My goal is to understand better to these agents of violence and study ways of encouraging the transition from violent participation to the confrontation not violent.
I do work in the field of politics and in the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solving almost everything in course, because the war has changed.
It used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between the states and actors and non-state actors.
For example, the <unk> arrangements of 1975 and 2011, <unk> had signed up between a state and an actor <unk>
So we need to understand these <unk> we even need to be <unk> or <unk> in any process of successful conflict.
But how do you do that?
We need to know what drives these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why they are doing it, but nobody looks at what they do when they don't <unk>
The armed fight and the political fight are <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global vision.
The armed groups today are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for the violent <unk> against Israel.
From its creation in the 1980s, <unk> <unk> has also established a political party -- a network of social services and a military <unk>
Similarly, the Palestinian <unk> known for their suicide attacks against Israel, also runs the <unk> of Gaza since 2007.
So these groups make more than just fire.
They're multitasking now.
They have a complicated machinery of communication stations from radio television, TV centers, websites and strategies in social networks.
And here you have <unk> magazine in English and published to <unk>
<unk> groups are also investing in a complex fundraising <unk> but through business <unk> for example, construction companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funding, to recruit them better and build their brand.
<unk> groups are also doing something else else -- create stronger ties to their population by investing in social services.
They build schools, run by hospitals, put in professional training programs or <unk>
<unk> offers all of these services and more.
The armed groups are also trying to conquer the population by offering something that not <unk> security and protection.
The ascent of Taliban in an Afghanistan torn by the war or even the beginning of the ascent of <unk> it can be understood by the efforts of these groups for giving security.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a price strategy for the population.
But in general, providing social services that means filling an <unk> a <unk> gap by government, and it allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the election election of 2006 from Palestinian Hamas cannot be understood without recognizing the social work of the group.
It's a really complex stage, even in the West, when we look at groups -- we just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or the long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they have <unk> gaps by government, and emerge as armed groups and political groups, participate in nonviolent struggle and bring governance.
And the more complex and sophisticated these are these organizations, less we can make it like something opposite to a state.
How do you call a group like <unk>
And you know, part of a territory of a territory run all of the <unk> they collect the trash, <unk> the <unk> system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's another thing, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states, of nations without state and hybrids and the more weak ones are the states, like in the Middle East, the more <unk> and they fill that gap the non-state actors.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more in the American tools.
<unk> that gap of government has to be in the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and supporting peace.
If we understand better than groups -- we will understand better than incentives to deliver the transition from violence to the violence.
In this new dispute between states and non-state actors, the military power can win some <unk> but it won't give us peace and stability.
In order to achieve these goals we need long-term investments to fill that safety, to fill out that vacuum of government that allowed these groups to thrive in a very beginning.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman and a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality are <unk> but I'm afraid to accept openly the <unk> tag would be unfair to the <unk>
I'm a <unk> but pretty bad really.
And therefore I became a feminist like a <unk>
Or at least I wrote a paper, and a book called "The <unk> <unk> and then on interviews, people started calling the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to myself and a <unk> <unk> has become something larger.
Let me give you a step back.
When I was a young man, especially in my youth and 20 years, I had strange ideas about the <unk> these women, <unk> women with men and <unk> sex as if that was a bad thing.
Today, I see how women are treated all over the world, and the anger, in particular, seems a perfectly reasonable answer.
But at that time, I was worried about the tone that I was using the people in the <unk> that might be a feminist.
Being labeled as a feminist was a <unk> a taboo and nasty word.
I was going to tell me as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, which is asking too much, with high self-esteem and <unk> to believe that it's like or superior to a man.
Nobody wants to be that <unk> woman until he realizes that it's actually that woman and he can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I grew up, I began to accept that I am, in fact, feminist, and also, so proud to be.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
<unk> the same paycheck for the same work.
We have right to travel around the world like <unk> free or violence.
We have right to use easy to use it and accessible to contraceptives and services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, without needing <unk> or doctrines <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to have to account our other <unk>
We're not only women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and a lot of social condition -- and a lot more.
We need to have to realize these differences and how we behave in the same way that it matters what we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear: I'm a mess.
I'm full of contradictions.
There is a lot of things that make me a bad feminist.
I have another confession.
When I drive to work, I hear rap music <unk>
Though the letter degrades up to the women and makes me quite deeply, the classic <unk> of the yin <unk> <unk> is amazing.
<unk> with your t-shirt <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you give you the <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm completely <unk> by my musical ear.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk> --  all the <unk> tasks, but also killing insects, the <unk> of grass and the maintenance of <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
<unk> is my favorite color.
And they were talking about fashion magazines and very nice things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies of the fairy tales that make reality.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the name of her husband, it's his choice, and I'm not who for <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home to raise her children, and they don't get that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable to the same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> in a way that it makes women economically vulnerable when they <unk>
And we got this problem.
<unk> the conventional feminism has ignored or <unk> historically the needs of women of color, the gay workers, gay workers, gay women and <unk> for white women, <unk> middle class and high.
Listen, if that's good feminism is a very bad feminist
It also happens to happen, as a feminist, I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to put psychologists in a <unk>
We hope that I'm going to get perfection.
When we get rid of the <unk> with a lot of pleasure from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I think I think of that <unk> before you try to put up there.
<unk> women, particularly innovative and the leaders of the sector, are afraid of being tagged as <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I am <unk> because of fear that means that <unk> fear of not being able to fulfill the <unk> expectations of it.
Let's take <unk> or like I call it, <unk>
In the last few years, it's a <unk> feminist
In the <unk> Music Valley 2014, <unk> <unk> in front of the word <unk> <unk>
It was a show <unk> watching this pop star openly and to know the women and the young men who be feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, the cultural critics began a endless argument if <unk> was a feminist or not a feminist.
<unk> their feminism, instead of simply believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
<unk> perfection because we're still fighting a lot, we want a lot, we need so much <unk>
We're going to be far beyond sensible criticism and <unk> to <unk> feminism for any woman, <unk> until it won't be anything.
We don't need to do that.
<unk> or rather, an <unk> feminism is the point of <unk>
But what happens next?
We went from recognizing our <unk> to give it up, and to be a little bit more <unk>
If I listen to music, I am creating a demand for artists that would be more happy to provide a <unk> supply.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until they <unk> the change effectively affecting their profit.
It's certainly hard.
Why has their music to be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a better choice.
But when bad decisions make this make it more difficult for women to achieve equality, the equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my three and four years old.
These are two girls and <unk> and bright and also too brave. I want you to grow in a world.
where they were excited about the strong creatures that they are.
And I think of them, all of a sudden, the best choice will be <unk> as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program is dealing with sexual violence against women like sport, <unk> the Game of <unk>
We can change the radio station when we hear songs that treat women like anything.
We can spend our money to go to film on the other part when movies are not treating women more than as a <unk>
We can stop supporting professional sports where athletes treat their classmates as <unk>
In any case, men, especially poor men can say, "No, I'm not going to post in your journal to participate in your project, to be working on your project, to work with you, until it doesn't include a number enough of women, so much to participate as to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a wider range of people."
Those of us who are <unk> but they will engage to participate in this kind of projects, we can also force them to be even more as well as others are being used to overcome the barriers to the decision needs.
Because we are not <unk> <unk> Without these efforts, without embracing these <unk> our accomplishments are going to mean very little.
We can make these small decisions of courage and hope that our decisions will come to the top of the people in the power of directors and cinema and music, <unk> the <unk> the people who can make great decisions, more courageous, to create a lasting lasting change.
We can also claim to do with our feminism, well, bad, or any <unk>
The last line of my book, <unk> <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad feminist to not be in <unk>
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I tell you, especially because I said, my voice was <unk> and feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it an incident to address what happened.
A few guys asked me when I was a young man, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
They treated me as if it was nothing.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
I had my voice, and after everything I didn't believe I would say something that might matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I became a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and the women who looked like me and understood what it meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of the women that showed me that it was nothing.
I learned how to write like them, and then I learned to write as myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing and feminism, I also found that if I was a little brave another woman could hear me and see that none of us are the nothing that the world is trying to tell us that we are.
In one hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And in the other hand, I do do the bold reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad feminist, I'm a good feminist, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I say and what I do, without leaving everything that makes me human.
I hope we can all do the same thing.
I hope that we can all be a little bit brave when you need such a <unk>
Right after Christmas last year, <unk> children in California, had <unk> to have visited <unk> or being exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, we went to more than 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things about this outbreak is that the <unk> that can be lousy for a child with a immune system -- is one of the most easily <unk> diseases in the world.
There's an effective vaccine against this for more than half a century -- but a lot of the children involved in the outbreak had had not been immunized because their parents were afraid of something supposed to be supposed to be connected to autism.
But a moment, it was not the article that broke the argument about autism and <unk> vaccines on and marked by being a foreign fraud by British Medical Center.
It doesn't believe the majority of smart scientists that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of fathers around the world are still <unk> that vaccines put in danger to their children having autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the growth of autism growth in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very bizarre disease.
The few psychologists and pediatricians who had heard about her create the entire professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, the prevalence estimates continued only three or four children per <unk>
But then, in the 1990s the numbers started to <unk>
<unk> for fundraising <unk> is referred to routinely autism as an epidemic, as if I could get another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you're not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people about the Center for Disease Control what's going on, they tend to be based on phrases like <unk> <unk> and "a better detection of <unk> to explain these <unk> numbers.
But that kind of language doesn't <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother who searches in the face of her two years, the visual contact.
If the yield criteria had to be <unk> why they were so <unk> at the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism so hard to find before the decade of <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less to do with slow progress and <unk> of the science that with the sense of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, doctors told a story about what autism and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we got here and where we need to go.
The first story starts with a child psychiatrist -- Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hospital -- <unk> <unk> published a paper that describes 11 young patients who looked like <unk> private worlds, <unk> people around them, even their own parents.
They could give fun for hours by waving their hands to their faces, but they were prey by <unk> as when they didn't put his favorite toy in his usual place without knowing it.
Over the basis of the patients treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
For the 1950s, as a major authority of the world on the subject, declared that I had seen less than 150 true cases of their syndrome as they were <unk> from places as far as South Africa.
This is actually not surprisingly, because the criteria for the diagnosis of autism were very <unk>
For example, <unk> giving that diagnosis to children with seizures but now we know that the epilepsy is very common in autism.
And once he realized that he had become nine of every 10 children sent by other doctors to his office for being autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of eating <unk> caused by cold parents and <unk>
These kids, he said, they've kept them carefully on a refrigerator that doesn't <unk>
At the same time, though, I noticed that some of their young patients had special skills that we cluster in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the kids in the clinic could tell between 18 <unk> before the two years.
When his mother put one of his favorite record, he correctly said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, saying things like the children were simply telling us what they had heard about their parents who were desperate to win their approval.
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own well, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the decade of 1970, the researchers started testing the theory of <unk> that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> cognitive psychologist in London, I thought the theory of welfare mothers was pretty stupid.
She and his husband John were warm and <unk> and they had a deep autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a girl as eating services, without special education, and no access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To stand for the National Health Service, that they needed more resources for autistic children and their families, Judith <unk> and French colleague, Judith decided to do anything that should be done 30 years before.
They did a study of autism prevalence in the general population.
It was a suburb of London called <unk> to try to find the autistic children in the community.
What you saw clearly the model of <unk> was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more <unk> and diverse was a lot more <unk>
Some children couldn't talk at all, while others were <unk> in their fascination by astrophysics, in dinosaurs or the <unk> of <unk>
In another way, these kids didn't fit in wonderful frames and <unk> as they said, and they saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At first, they were lost for trying to make sense of their data.
How did no one realized these kids before?
But then <unk> I found a reference to an article published in German in <unk> the next year to the paper of <unk> and then he got <unk> buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> knew about this article from competition, but I avoided <unk> in his own work.
There was not even a translation to the English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> talked German, and he was doing it for her.
The document offers a alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran an integrated clinic with a school company in Vienna, in the 1930s.
<unk> ideas for teaching children with learning differences were <unk> even for contemporary contemporary standards.
The morning in their clinic started with music, and the children would follow their games on Sunday for late.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger's described as a <unk> disability, of life that required <unk> <unk> and space adapted over the course of all life.
Instead of treating kids in their clinic as patients, Asperger's called them their little teachers, and they started to help in the development of education methods that were especially right for them.
And <unk> saw autism as a diverse diverse continuum that included an amazing variety of gifts, and disability.
He believed that autism and human traits were common, and they have always been, seeing aspects of this continuum in <unk> known in the pop culture as the awkward social scientist and Professor <unk>
He was beyond even until the success of science and art, a little bit of autism is essential.
<unk> and Judith found that <unk> was wrong where autism was <unk> as well as the parents were the <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked in silence with the American Association of <unk> to extend the criteria of the diagnostics that reflect the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
By the end of the 1980s and the early '90s, their changes came into <unk> <unk> the limited model of <unk> by a broad and <unk>
These changes were no broken <unk>
<unk> when <unk> and Judith worked with each other to reform these <unk> people around the world see an adult adult for the first time.
Before I came out of <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a little circle, <unk> by experts knew what autism, but after <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> with four awards from <unk> <unk> psychologists, teachers and fathers around the world knew what the autism was.
At the same time, these first clinical trials were introduced to use autism.
I didn't have to have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a network, a perfect storm of consciousness of autism.
The number of diagnoses started <unk> the same as they predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact they hoped that the people with autism and their families finally embraced the support and services that were <unk>
Then Andrew <unk> came to blame vaccines by the increase in the <unk> a simple, powerful history of <unk> <unk> history as bad as the <unk> theory that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of the heart of prevention that one of every 68 children in America are at the spectrum, it's right at the spectrum, the autistic are one of the world's largest groups in the world.
In the last few years, people have joined the Internet to reject the idea that the puzzles are going to solve by the new breakthroughs and doctors, <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand <unk> is to think about terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to <unk> standards, the normal human brain is easily <unk> social <unk> and suffers from a attention deficit to detail.
<unk> people have difficulty living in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still getting <unk> who believed that <unk> for the most <unk> aspects of autism are in understanding teachers, employers with capacity, communities and parents with faith in the potential of their children.
An autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on cover to <unk> the ship of the <unk>
As we outsource to an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges that we face as a society.
We cannot afford to waste a brain.
Thank you.
